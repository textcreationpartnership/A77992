         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>The Scope of this Book, is to set the soul upon a sure Bottom for Eternity, to call off this heady, guiddy Age from perverse disputings to heart-searching, that people may not take shews and shadows for real substances, thinking they stand stedfast in the Faith, when they only stand strong and steadfast in their own fancies; so drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping to Hell unexpectedly with a fals-grounded Hope and Security. The Author saw to his grief upon what weak Bottoms many lay the weight of their Hopes for their everlasting Salvation; mens understandings shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with light whose lives are as noysom as dunghills; men (as they say of Toads) having Pearls in their Heads, but their Bodies full of deadly Poyson: He saw how a Laodecean self-conceited fulness was in his time (as it yet is) the reigning sin of our daies, and a more dangerous desperate Enemy to Christ and his Grace than gross Prophaness; I say the Author saw fearful guile lying upon mens Consciences who were Protestants in Doctrine, but Recusants in their
<pb facs="tcp:118704:5"/> Lives, possessed with a lazie spirit of slothfulness, self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceitedness, and self-flattery, who would rather ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture to go down to Hell in a sweet dream quietly, than to be inwardly touch'd and try'd, than to set them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves upon the torturing painful rack of Examination. Therefore the Reader shall find in all the Works of this holy Man, an earnest endeavor to lay open the Sound, and False Foundations of Christian Buildings: and indeed how sad is it to consider how men flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in their imaginary twinklings, hugging their own fancies, which may perhaps have the sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:118704:6"/> Sence, or at the best, a life of Reason a little refined and elevated above ordinary, by Natural and acquired helps, and the improvement of the Common Gifts, and Graces of the Spirit; not saving, not sanctifying; and because men fall into Spiritual Consumptions apace by too much familiarity and fellowship with sin, and for want of timely looking to, get such Soul-blows, such Spirit-wounds, that the pangs of their after-birth, comes to cost them as much, and to be as bitter as those of the first Birth, I mean of the New Birth. Here there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Saints may find proper and sovereign Salves for raising up, and establishing their languishing Spirits, for joynting their disjoynted souls, and setting together their broken bones in a Gospel way, which is not by frigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the soul to Hell, and swallowing it up of overmuch grief and sorrow, and after that season is over, to tell them then they are too much dejected, and it's time now to begin to take heart and comfort to themselves, but by leading them to the Brazen Serpent, to the Rock that is higher than they, to Jesus Christ who is able to save to the uttermost all that come to the Father in his Name, seeing he ever lives to make intercession: By setting this home<note place="margin">Heb. 7. 25.</note> upon your Consciences, that they have too little exalted Christ in their hearts, and too little lifted up their hearts by Faith in Christ, and that as the greatest dishonor they can put upon Christ is by distrusting his Promise of free Grace and Mercy; so the greatest honor they can put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, is to give Glory to him by beleeving. Here thou shalt find how Faith laughs Death, Sin, Hell, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction in the face, and how it lives and looks out smi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly in the most blustering storms, deadliest confusions, and darkest midnight of desertion that can come upon the soul. Thou shalt here learn how to kill thy fears and doubts that they may never outgrow thy Faith any more.</p>
            <p>Here thou shalt find what a blind Guide Sence and Reason is in the things of God, nay how far short san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
<pb facs="tcp:118704:6"/> Reason comes of attaining the great Mysteries of Salvation without the Spirit of Faith and Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Knowledg of Christ. How Reason in its primaeve estate, is uncapable of the way of the Gospel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Ground of Faith is meerly Divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Thou shalt here learn, whilst others are poring upon, and digging into the Creature for satisfaction, meeting with nothing but vanity and vexation, and finding Cole-pits instead of Gold-Mines; I say thou shalt here learn, how by Faith to take up and satisfie thy self in one God alone, that thou mayest say with the Psalmist, <hi>Psal. 73. Whom have I in Heaven but thee? and I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire none in Earth besides thee;</hi> or as the Chaldee Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrase hath it, <hi>I have no Companion on Earth with thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Precious Faith</hi> the Author speaks of, will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade thee that it's not the Creature, but God in it that gives comfort and content; as it is not the Posset-Ale, but the Potion that works. <hi>Faith</hi> will tell thee, the Creature can do neither good nor hurt without God. They who live by Sence upon the Creature, will be still chiding with the Creature, and vexing at it; as the People living upon <hi>Moses,</hi> eyeing him more than God, were alwaies chiding with <hi>Moses</hi> in all disappointments. Now they who live by Faith upon God, their souls will still keep silence before him, and be turning in upon him whether their trouble come from sin within, or sorrow without. The soul that hath once truly by Faith tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched Christ, will be like the needle in the Marriners Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass, that will never stand still, till it be full North; and though a jog of temptation may turn it aside some times from Christ it's resting place; yet it still trembles, and is restless till it can point it self full towards Christ again, there setling and quieting it self, and resting as a stone at the Center.</p>
            <p>And because the waies and Works of God and men
<pb facs="tcp:118704:7"/> are much in the dark, and no eye but the eye of Faith can find out the walks of either, I know (saith a holy man) where God treads, though he treads upon the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters (where he leaves no visible fool-steps behind him) Here therefore thou shalt learn how to reconcile Gods Wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d and Works, when Promises and Providences seem to cross &amp; thwart one another. When the soul by the eye of Faith sooks into the Word of God, and sees what is there promised to the Church and People of God, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, all things are well, very well, and will be so; but when it comes down from the Mount, gazing and jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging by Sence of the Works of God, it concludes al things are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll, very ill, and likely to continue so: It's through the want or weakness of Faith, that we cannot put the Word of Promise, and Works of Providence in an harmoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous way together: When Sight and Sence cries out, here is nothing but jarring and division, Faith saith here is union and harmony, even as discords bound with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords makes the sweetest Musick; they who have but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or no Faith, will still be reading riddles in the dark midnight of these distractions, confusions, divisions, and unequal administrations amongst us, whilst faith ploughs with the right Heifer, gets into the bosom of Christ, and knows all his heart and meaning in those things that stumble and amaze the world.</p>
            <p>Let me yet ad further, Thou shalt here learn how to walk by Faith with an unchangable spirit inchangable conditions. As a Watch though tossed in the pocket, yet keeps even motion; or as the Cork in a Net keeps it from being drawn under water by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he Lead, so those soul-refreshing Comforts enjoyed in God will keep the head and heart above water when the soul seens to be up to the chin in misery: Faith I say will still keep the heart above, like the Lark up<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n the wing, singing continually; and it will keep the soul in an even temper, being neither too much under the comforts of life, nor terrors of death; it will bring the Creature in subjection to us, and set our
<pb facs="tcp:118704:7"/> selves and it in the proper place where both should stand. Whilst by Faith the soul keeps Christ and Heaven in its heart, it hath the Moon under foot, and is not great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly moved at things that fal out every day, though cross to the grain of Natural desires and expectations. Faith will keep the soul cleer in the midst of temptations, like the Israelites walking on dry Land safely, and the Seas on each side; or like <hi>Peter</hi> on the Waters. Faith wil abase the beauty of the World without, and tame lusts within: it will let us see the World is gain in the loss of it, and loss in the gain of it; it wil assure us, that what we leave and deny for Christ, we shal find in him. Faith wil wean from, and moderate affections to the world; for by uniting the soul to Christ, it makes it like him. Now Christ ruled his Affections, anger, grief, joy, desire: the High-Priest was girt about the Paps; so Christ, and that with a Golden Girdle, <hi>Rev. 1. 13.</hi> and so are al the Saints in their measure, being baptized into the same spirit, and partakers of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Now to be girt about the Paps shews how those stirrings of our affections, all those motions, thoughts, and inclinations of our hearts should be kept in order by the indwelling of the Spirit. Whilst mens experiences tels them every flower in the worlds Garden either hath pricks, or smels ill; and that like a dirty Dog, the world besmears with fawning, and that all the choicest contentments in it are mingled with much bitter, as a good day between two Agues: Now Faith comes in as a Super addition to experience, with more over powring arguments, weaning from the Breasts of Creatures by holding forth a fuller Breast of more satisfying good in things above.</p>
            <p>To conclude, Thou shalt learn how by Faith to keep all thy other Graces alive, still active and operative, which is a blessed frame of heart: this makes the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian indeed, when the heart of a man is heated with burning love, as well as his head enlightened with shining
<pb facs="tcp:118704:8"/> light: the power of Godliness lies in the Affections, Grace is for operation as its perfection, therefore the Commands of God are for the Acts, not simply for the Habits, little to chuse twixt having no grace, and dull sleepy habits unacted, I mean in regard of service and usefulness to God and man: <hi>Stir up the Gift of God that's in thee,</hi> saith <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> 2 Tim. 1. 6. that is, blow up that living spark within thee, for so the word implies, alluding to the fire of the Alter, which was to be kept in, and blown up continually. Christ should be in the heart of a Christian, not as a Jewel in a Cabinet, to be kept secret, but as a spring in a Watch, to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies in motion: For want of this stirring up, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting Grace continually, temptations come upon us, and do what they will with us, even as standing Waters stink and putrifie if they have not vent, and do not run continually.</p>
            <p>And now Reader thou seest of what singular use this Treatise may be to thee in these heart-shaking, trembling, and patient assaulting times wherein we live: here is one singular use and benefit wherein this precious Grace of Faith besteads the soul in evil times, <hi>viz.</hi> Not to be afraid of evil tydings, Faith fixing the soul upon Christ, fences the heart against slavish fears, <hi>Psal. 112. 7.</hi> The hour of Darkness and Temptation is now upon the World to try the Inhabitants thereof; blessed are they who watch and keep their Garments pure; such have the Promise to be kept from (or at least in, and therefore from) this hour of temptation. <hi>England</hi> this day is like the woman with the Issue of Blood who had spent all her living upon Physitians, and yet could not be heal'd by any. We never look'd to have seen such deadly bloody work in <hi>England</hi> so long continued; and after all that such revolutions and wheelings about of things again into the old path; How long shall <hi>England</hi> bleed before good blood appear? Much is already run out, and
<pb facs="tcp:118704:8"/> what bleeding is yet behind the Lord knows, Divine Justice is throughly awake, yet <hi>England</hi> is not awake: How justly might the Lord say unto <hi>England,</hi> Sleep on now? The time is at hand that thou shalt see what it is to play the wantons with the Word: Justly may the Lord say to Magistrates and Ministers, The season is now upon you that you shall with tears of blood, rue and lament the loss of the precious opportunities put into your hands, of advancing my Waies, my Truths, my Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship in <hi>England:</hi> Sloth, Cowardice, Hellish Policy, base Ends, shall now slay the Womb that hath conceived and bread all these: Righteous is the Lord in every drop of Blood; We have had many Allarums, many War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, Soundings in our Ears many yeers together, yet not awakened, not reformed: How great is the misery upon us, and how little do we feel it? Our misery, like great blows on the head rather stupifie our sences than beget any kindly feeling in us; our Sun may be neerer a setting than we are aware of, I mean the Candlestick removing; it was never Gods end to send his Gospel to this Nation and continue it so long that people should bring forth such wild Grapes as <hi>England</hi> hath done; Is this Commodity of so low a value think we, that it cannot have vent in any other Nation but in ours? Must this glorious Gospel needs be laid aside as a refuse Commodity in a corner, if <hi>England</hi> will not give it Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit? Is the Lord so beholding to us for a dry, sapless, fruitless Profession of the Gospel in <hi>England?</hi> How soon can the Lord make us the scorn and derision of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as hitherto we have been the Glory of the World? How soon may the Lord turn the Key, shut up doors, and be gone, and send his Gospel to a People that will bring forth better fruit than <hi>England</hi> hath done? How easily can he of stones raise up children to <hi>Abraham,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his sons from far, and his daughters from the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test corners of the Earth? Wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, if discerning spirits, sees not the Glory in great measure departed from <hi>England?</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:118704:9"/> Where is the Lord powerfully present in his Ordinances with success and blessing as he was wont to be? How blind are our Watch-men? how miserably have our Leaders in Church and State corrupted their way through false heartedness to Christ, taking up in the gainfullest, easiest, cheapest way of Religion? going to <hi>Egypt</hi> again, and turning back the People with them, saying it's best and safest to sit down by the old flesh-pots: Is this the fruit of begging so long at Heaven Gate, spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding so much Blood, and laying out so many Millions?</p>
            <p>But I have already I see exceeded my bounds, I shall therefore now abruptly conclude, leaving the Reader and this useful Treatise to the Blessing of the Almighty.</p>

               <item>
                  <hi>CHAP. XI. XIII.</hi> Faith is precious, because it's the special Grace that glorifies God most. 43</item>

               <item>
                  <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> Shewing the Scope and Meaning of the Words, what is meant by <hi>Walking,</hi> what by <hi>Sight;</hi> That Christians walk not by carnal Sence, nor spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Sence, nor by natural Reason, nor by spiritual Reason only, but a Principle above all these, namely, <hi>Faith. 161</hi>
               </item>
               <item>
                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Wherein the Text is opened: and it is shewed that Worldlings guide their way according to sight, <hi>i. e.</hi> of their Eyes, and according to their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sences, and according to their natural Reason. 1 The end they propound to themselves is some sensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al good. 2 They judg of things according to Sence. 3 Though they have somtimes some convictions and good affections, the main work of their lives is for some good of sence. 166</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Shewing the great evil of walking by Sence. 1 It is beneath a rational Creature, who hath his Reason given him to correct Sence in Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things; and in things that concern his everlasting Happiness also, at least negatively, to shew him where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his felicity doth not consist. 2 It is infinitely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the spirit of Wisdom. 3 They who are acted by sence, are liable to continual temptations, because the Devil gets into the Rational Soul by the Sensitive first. 4 Men living by sence, are besotted, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God in the World, very unlikely to come to come to good because the way of Gods bringing to Eternal Life, is above Reason, and above, and contrary to sence; and they who never mind an higher end in the way of their lives, shall perish. 171</item>

               <item>
                  <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> The Saints walk not by Sence. 1 They give no liberty to the Eyes of their Bodies or thoughts to behold va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, but pluck out the corruption of their Eyes. 2 They hold on their course though things seem to go never so cross according to sence. 3 They cannot by sence apprehend those great things that take their hearts most. 4 They walk not by sence in respect of spiritual things, but by faith, in the exercise where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, God hath his chief glory upon Earth. 177</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> An Admonition to yong Converts, that think the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease and decrease of sence and joy, is the encrease and decrease of Grace. 187</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> Worldly men walk according to what they apprehend to be Reason, and that's their happiness; and 'tis good in the way of Justice between man and man, not in Gods Worship and Eternal Happiness. Five Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions how they are acted by Reason in the course of their lives, and in Gods Worship. 190</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Reason is not that which should guide a Christian. 1 Reason not corrupted, is uncapable of the way of the Gospel. 2 Reason corrupted is enmity with God, both in the Apprehensive and Discursive part. 194</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> Reason carrieth men upon corrupt Principles. As 1 It is not good to engage too far in any Cause. 2 It is the safest way to go according to the common streams of the times, and places where we live. 3 Not to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture present things for future, certain for uncertain. 4 It is not likely that a poor contemptible in an, should understand more than the Learned. 5 To be happy, and to be poor and persecuted, are inconsistent. 6 Good meanings, and performance of good duties, are suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to make us accepted of God. 7 Zeal from some be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond others, must needs come from Hypocrisie. 196</item>
               <pb facs="tcp:118704:15"/>
               <item>
                  <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> Spiritual Truths are above the light of Natural Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. As, 1 The necessity of a new Birth. 2 The more a wicked man prospers, the more cursed he is. 3. That God should work the worst things for the Saints good. 4 That the Promises are the greatest riches. 5 That all the World is vanity. 6 That we must be righteous by the righteousness of another. 7. That the Foundation of all Happiness, is self-denial. 8. That there is greater evil in the least sin, than in the greatest affliction. 199</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>CHAP. X.</hi> The danger of mens walking by Reason. 1 The way of the Gospel is above Reason, Rhetorick, and Logick. 2 Reason is excellent, but if we walk according to it, it hardneth against God. 3 The Word works upon weak men sooner than wise, because they cannot fence off the Truth, as wise men with corrupt hearts. 4 It makes men slight in spiritual Duties, without Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. 5 They will not go through with a Duty, but start aside at every difficulty. 6 If God work grace upon them, they will be fuller of doubts than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in whose understanding the Devil hath no forge 203</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>CHAP. XI. Use 1.</hi> We must not follow the example of men of Parts. <hi>Use 2.</hi> Men of Parts must be humble. <hi>Use 3.</hi> In the work of Conversion, judg not according to Reason. <hi>Use 4.</hi> To rebuke those that come not so high as Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, or as Heathens. <hi>Use 5.</hi> Saints must have a Principle above sanctified Reason. 209</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>CHAP. XII.</hi> Saints expect greater glory than they understand: The ground of Faith is Divine Revelation, and this is different from Knowledg, though sanctified, which must be done away, when we shall understand not by way of Reason as now, but by the immediate presence of God. 214</item>
               <pb facs="tcp:118704:16"/>

                  <hi>CHAP. XIII.</hi> The Walk of a Saint on Earth, is the Walk of Faith. What the Walk of Faith is, is described, 1 Generally. 2 Particularly. <hi>First,</hi> In respect of its End, which is Twofold: 1 The enjoyment of Communion with God. 2 The glorifying of God (both in a Gospel way.) <hi>Secondly,</hi> In respect of its Rule. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In respect of its Separation from uncleanness in thoughts and actions. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> In respect of its acting upon Christ for strength to walk. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> In respect of its acting upon Christ for strength, 1 To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist oppositions, persecutions, outward and inward. 2 To get above discouragements. 3 To be carried through difficulties. <hi>Sixtly,</hi> In respect of its perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of Duties without self-ends. <hi>Seventhly,</hi> In respect of its real satisfaction without enjoyment. <hi>Eightly,</hi> In respect of its dependancy upon God in want of means. <hi>Ninthly,</hi> In respect of its Progress. <hi>Tenthly,</hi> Of its constancy. <hi>Eleventhly,</hi> Of its su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableness to things beleeved. 219</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>CHAP. XIV.</hi> The Saints in all Ages have walked by faith. 1 Enoch. 2 Noah. 3 Abraham. 4 Jacob. 5 All the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarks. 6 David. 7 Jonah. 8 Church, though they had less means, and a less glorious Object than we have. 230</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>CHAP. XV.</hi> The necessity of walking by Faith: 1 Because the waies of God are mean and vile to Sence and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. 2 That there may be an agreement between us and God. 3 Because many things that are the Rule of our lives, depend meerly upon the will of God revealed without Reason. 4 That we may see the Authority of the Rule, and make it come with power to our hearts. 5 That we may see the reallity of Spiritual things. 6 That we may see through the colors and vain shews that are put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="tcp:118704:16"/> the waies of Sin. 7 Because the waies of God do somtimes seem contrary to his Word. 8 Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of oppositions, outward and inward. 9 Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause by it only we please God. 10 Because the End of the Saints Walking, is above Reason. 11 Because the efficacy of all means we use for any good, depends upon Faith. 236</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>CHAP. XVI. Of the Excellenty of Faith.</hi> Walking by Faith is Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent: 1 Because it hath higher apprehensions of God than others have. 2 It makes Civil and Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral actions, Heavenly. 3 It brings delight to the soul. 4 It makes us converse much with God in all things we do. 5 By it we most honor God. 6 The soul is freed from fears by it. 7 It makes us do great things for God. 8 It makes a great progress in the waies of God. 9 It causeth uprightness in the heart. 10 We have Salvation present. 11 It is useful in all conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. 12 It brings a good report from God himself. 13 It makes us die comfortably. 246</item>

                  <hi>CHAP. XVIII.</hi> Helps for the soul in its walking by Faith. 1 What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever our case is, we have to deal with an All-seeing God. 2 Gods Word is more to be relied upon than his Works. 3 All good that is in all Creatures is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minently in God. 4 No Creature in Heaven or Earth, hath the least power to do good or hurt, any further than God pleaseth to let out himself through them. 5 The way of God in working for his Saints, is often above, without, and contrary to means. 6 God puts the sentence of death upon a thing before he gives
<pb facs="tcp:118704:17"/> it. 7 Whatsoever Promise i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <item>
                  <hi>CHAP. XIX.</hi> Encouragements to the soul in its walking by Faith. 1 God tenders himself to all to whom the Gospel comes, in a Covenant of Grace, and not of Works. 2 All the good that God doth for his Creatures, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially in order to eternal Life, is for his Names sake. 3 There is no qualification in the Creature that is made by God as a condition to our belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. 4 It is the great Glory of God, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign that he hath in the world, to glorifie himself in the way of his free Grace, and faithfulness towards men. 5 It's as delightful to Christ to have the end of his Death, as to us to have our souls saved. 6 God leaves his People without Sence of his love for many good ends to them. 7 God▪ hath more Glory in saving than in casting off. 268</item>

It is a glorious thing to beleeve in want of Sence. 6 It is that which honors God more than any other Grace. 7 It argues very much love to God. 8 Faith is wrought by the Almighty Power of God.</item>

                        </gap>hyer than you; no, it was meerly by Gods free grace and love, and not from any thing in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: For you have obtained like precious faith with
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:118704:20"/> us, as if the Apostle should say, whereas all the world was in his presence, only God through his free grace made it your lot to have precious faith, that you should be inriched with this unspeakable gift, that this lot should be your portion, and others should have their lot fall to have some part of the Earth, he gives the Earth to the children of men. Take a whol Congregation of Town, all of them to come into the presence of God for to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their lot, saith God, I will give such a man such an estate in the world, he shal be a Master of a Ship, and he shall have so much Money or Lands, that shall be his lot; another he comes to have his lot, and he shall have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent parts, I'le give him the tongue of the Learned, and so get credit that way; and another he shall be born of such and such Parentage, he shall spring from the Loyns of Nobles, and their blood shall run in his veins: thus God casts from all eternity the lots of men: and there comes another, he shall not have much in this world, but he shall have faith in Jesus, and he shall have Heaven and Eternal Life, that shall be his lot: And thus God from all Eternity gives every one their several lot and portion. Your lot is to have precious Faith, Oh your lot is fallen into a good ground, you have a blessed Inheritance, you were in the presence of God when there were all men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, Unbeleevers, Heathens, and Infidels, they were before God, it might have been their lot to have had Faith, and you might have had what they have: No, but it's your lot to have precious Faith, and it is their lot to possess the world. This is the meaning of the word <hi>Obtained,</hi> and the elegancy of the Phrase is by the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish word exceedingly much darkned and eclipsed. Obtained <hi>like precious Faith;</hi> not only <hi>precious faith,</hi> but <hi>LIKE</hi> precious Faith, <hi>Like</hi> with us; as if the Apostle should say, it's true, we are Apostles, and we have the priviledg in that, that we are the Apostles of Jesus Christ, and are called to this great Office, and so Jesus Christ hath graced us with gifts fit for such an Office
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:118704:20"/> as he hath called us unto, but there's not any one of you, the poorest and meanest Beleever that is, the weakest Christian that is a Beleever, that hath the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est parts of you all, but your Faith is <hi>like</hi> precious with our Faith; God hath in this made you equal with us, though perhaps the Lord hath not given unto you such gifts as to us, though you are not able to preach as we are able to preach; as if the Apostle should say, you have not the gift of miracles as we have, nor call'd to such a publick work; perhaps some of you are servants and yong ones, I but you have the like preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Faith with us, we own you to be our Brethren, we cannot look upon our selves as at such a great distance, though you be meaner otherwise, yet in regard of Faith (which is the most excellent grace of all) that you have the same with us; he doth not say you have as much faith as we, it may be the Apostles had more faith in degree than many of them, but you have the <hi>like</hi> precious faith in quality with us, it's of the same na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with ours, and by your Faith you are invested in the same Priviledges that we are, so that the Apostle would teach all such as are eminent Christians, and have more grace and gifts than others, and are imployed in more excellent things than others are, yet he would teach them not to despise the weakest and meanest Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, but look upon them with high esteem, as those that have obtained like precious Faith with them, it's a mighty expression that the poorest and meanest Beleever in the world is here rank'd with the Apostles, and so by the same reason may be rank'd with <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> you have the same precious Faith that they had, and that al the Prophets, Patriarchs, and the Apostles and Martyrs had: This the Apostle speaks to the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of very Babes in Christ that can only cry Abba Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a spirit of faith, <hi>To those that have obtained the same precious faith with us.</hi> Thus you have the meaning of the words: The precious Doctrinal Truths

                        <p>Three Observations raised. The first, That Faith is a Precious Grace: Explained. Wherein is shewed what Faith is.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>FIrst, <hi>That Faith is a most precious Grace.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>That the weakest Beleever that is, hath the same precious Faith with the strongest.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The third which ariseth from the propriety of the word, as it is by lot, <hi>That God wholly of his free grace without any cause in our selves hath made the difference between others and us.</hi> These are the three Points.</p>
                     <p>I shall principally treat of the <hi>preciousness of Faith;</hi> and the two following Points will be interwoven in the Prosecution and winding up of this most necessary and alwaies seasonable choice Truth, <hi>That Faith it is a most precious Grace,</hi> a Diamond, a Jewel of great price: This same Apostle in another place of this Epistle that he writ, the first Chapter, at the 7. Verse, saith, That <hi>the very tryal of their faith is much more precious than gold that perisheth;</hi> the very tryal of the Faith of the Saints is more precious than Gold, take all the Mines of Gold in the Earth, for a man to have but his Faith tryed is far more worth: now if it be more worth the having ones Faith tried than the Gold of the world, how much worth is Faith it self then? If a man hath Gold he would give somthing to have it tryed by the Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone; but if it be worth somthing to have it tried, what's the Gold worth if it proves true? Surely Faith is a precious thing, that the very tryal of it is more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious than Gold. Our Savior saith in 23. of <hi>Matt.</hi> 23.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:118704:21"/> verse, speaking of the great things of the Law, (saith he) rebuking the Pharisees that they were so exact in Cummin and Annis, in little things; but for the great things of the Law, as Mercy, and Judgment, and Faith, they neglected: I think it is meant between man and man, but by way of Argument, we may draw a confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of our Point in hand; If Faith between man and man be one of the great things of the Law, Oh what is our Faith in Jesus Christ! that's one of the great and weighty things of the Gospel, Faith is a most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious grace. Now for the opening of this, it is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to discover a little what Faith is, and then wherein the preciousness of Faith consists, and so come to the Application and improvement of the Point.</p>
                     <p>For the first, Faith is a most precious Grace; Faith, what faith? what is Faith?</p>
                     <p>Briefly thus: This Faith that we are here speaking of, it is that Grace of God whereby the soul receives Jesus Christ, according as he is offered in the Gospel.</p>
                     <p>Now Jesus Christ is tendered and offered as a full Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior, in whom all the Grace of God is fountain'd up, that the Lord intends to stream forth and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to the Children of men in order to eternal life, and Christ he is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>endered as one that hath all the Fulness of the Grace of God, that God purposeth to give out to all of the election of Grace in order to everlasting Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Now the Soul by Faith is enabled to receive and rest upon Jesus Christ alone; which Grace of God, Christ doth let out and bestow in the Dispensation of those three O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ces of his, in his Kingly, and Priestly, and Prophetical Offices, there Christ comes in with all the Grace and Goodness of God that the Lord intends for the children of men to save them eternally; it is by Faith the soul comes to apprehend this. First, being emptied of its self, and taken off from resting upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny creature comforts, broken cisterns, or from any thing in its self; and being enlightned to see into the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:118704:22"/> fulness and freeness of the Grace of God, that he hath put into his Son, it now comes and gives up its self to Jesus Christ, resigns up it self unto, and rols it self up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and rests upon him for all the good that God doth thus offer in Christ, so as it is willing to venture it self, to venture all the good it hath, and all it hopes for, it's willing to venture it all upon the Grace that it sees in Jesus Christ, and it satisfies it self in Christ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone: This is the nature of Faith in the general. Now such a Grace as this is, it is more worth than ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand worlds; when ever the Lord comes to bless a soul▪ with such a Grace, he doth give that soul more than if he gave it the possession of all that <hi>Adam</hi> enjoyed on this side Heaven in the morning of his Creation, yea, if he made ten thousand worlds for the sake of this soul, it would not be so much as the giving of the soul this grace of Faith.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>The Preciousness of Faith discovered: <hi>First,</hi> It's the fruit of Gods eternal Election. <hi>Secondly,</hi> It's Precious because it's Faith that first discries land in the storm of a troubled Conscience. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Faith is Precious in regard of it's Object.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>WHy? you wil say, wherein doth appear the Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of this Grace, that it is worth so much? 1 In the first place it is the friut of Gods Election and therefore Precious, it is the lot (as you heard in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening of the words) that God in his Free Grace grants to these Souls more than to others, and therefore that place I suppose cannot but be known in the <hi>Acts,</hi> where it is spoken of those that did beleeve, the Lord added to the Church such as should be saved, in <hi>Acts,</hi> 2. 41. But
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:118704:22"/> in another place it is said those that were ordained to life beleeved; it's the fruit of Gods ordination to life, And in the 1 <hi>Tit. 1 vers.</hi> It's called there the faith of Gods Elect; so that it's the first discovery that God from all eternity did separate this creature to do it good; what a Precious thing is that, that which is the first discovery of those eternal thoughts and counsels of love, that God had for the good of such a soul, that he did seperate this soul for himself to eternal life, is not that a precious thing? I say the first discovery of those eternal counsels of God, that he had thoughts concerning thy soul to do it good everlastingly. The soul that God hath set apart for himself from all eternity is in a blessed condition: I, but how can it be konwn, who can know whom God from all eternity, before the foundations of the Earth were laid, did Elect to himself? who can know this? If any one of you could know the Election of another, and the other party did not know it, you would think if I could but go and declare to this soul, that God had eternally Elected him, and make it sure to him, certainly I should be a most acceptable messenger of good news to him; Now Faith is the first thing that God sends to proclaim what these Determinations and Decrees and Counsels of God were for everlasting welfare of this soul from all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity. God that keeps in his own bosom as I may so say, his eternal purposes a long time, yet when the time comes for him to work Faith, now saith God I will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bosom my loves to this soul, and tell it what my heart hath been towards him to al eternity, and I wil send him a Jewel whereby he shal come to understand, that I from al eternity have Elected him to life. Suppose that the greatest man living, should set his heart upon such a man, and resolve that he will employ his Power and Honor and Riches to make such a man his Companion, but alass, the man is in the Prison all this while, well, this great man sends him a Diamond out of his own Crown, and sends it by his own Son to this man in the Prison, go saith
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:118704:23"/> he and carry him this Diamond, and tell him that this Diamond is to testifie to him, that I have set my heart up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and if I have any Power, Honor, or Riches, to make him great I wil lay it out for him; would not this be a Precious Diamond indeed to this man, if it should come upon such terms as these are, yea if it were but a little peice of Silver, if it came as a token of such a thing, as an earnest penny, it would be more worth than thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of pounds. Certainly where ever God savingly works Faith in the soul, and sends to this soul and that by the spirit of his own Son; he sends it as a testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to him, that he hath set his heart upon such a soul and intends for ever to do it good, when ever God wrought Faith in thy soul, he did as much as if he should say to thee, here, take this Grace for a certain argument, that I have set and fixed my heart upon thee from all eternity, and if I have any Power, and Mercy, if I have any Happiness in my self to make thee happy thou shalt be a happy Creature for ever, and take this as a testimony of it and make much of it, now is not this Precious, what's this worth that comes thus unto a soul? All you that have known experimentally, what the work of Faith hath meant in your own souls, take it thus as a sure pledg of Gods infinit eternal loves, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry time you meditate and think on the way of Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king this Grace in your hearts, be raised in your thoughts to prize and esteem of it, as that that hath come from God as the fruit of his eternal Election: It is the Faith of Gods Eelect, God may give unto a man Riches, and Ships, and good Voyages, and Kingdoms, and this no argument of his eternal love, if he should give him Kingdoms whats that? he might give a man or woman to be King or Queen of all the World, and yet such a one may be the object of his eternal hatred for all that, a vile person, the basest of men. Therefore there is not so much Preciousness in al these things, but when the Lord gives Faith, this is the Evidence of his eternal love, and that's the first thing.</p>
                     <pb n="11" facs="tcp:118704:23"/>
                     <p>Secondly, For the work of it, it is the first grace that doth discry (as I may so say) Land; when the soul is in the tempest and storm of a troubled conscience (you may make this as a branch of the former) it is the first grace that doth discry Land in the time of the extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that the soul is in, and therein the preciousness of it doth consist; the soul that doth understand its own mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery, the danger that it is in, the wrath of God that hangs over it, &amp; then trouble of conscience, so that it is as a man in the midst of a storm and tempest at Sea, and ready to be swallowed up in the waves of woful troubl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> of conscience, it is faith that doth get up upon the top of the mast, and cries, I see Land: you account that a precious thing if you be at Sea, &amp; ready to perish there, and do not know but that you are many hundred Leagues from Land, and yet if when you are ready to perish one get up upon the top of the Mast, and cries, Oh be of good comfort, I see Land, I see such a place, Oh you account that more to you than if so be you had had never so much money gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven you at that time, this is the work of faith, when the soul is in the midst of afflictions and troubles and waves of a troubled conscience tossing of it up and down that it doth apprehend its self ready to be swallowed up in the gulf of eternal dispair, sees it self ready to be plunged into, and swallowed up of the bottomless gulf of eternal misery, at that very time Faith is the grace that gets up upon the Mast, gets up upon some promise or other, and cries to the soul, I see Land, I discry hope of mercy, yet hope of help, though my condition be miserable, though I do apprehend a most dreadful breach between God and my soul, I have apprehended God as an eternal Enemy unto me, and have been afraid that I should have been the soul that should have lyen under the eternal curse of an infinite God, and have been fuel for his provoked wrath to all eternity; but blessed be God I see Land, I discry a way of help for such a soul as I am. Oh how precious is this Faith that doth enable the soul (I say)
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:118704:24"/> to discry hope in the time of the greatest extremities of all; God gives this Grace to the soul to discover hope when the heart is never so low, and ready to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Faith is a most precious Grace in this, That it hath the most excellent and glorious objects that can be, the preciousness of the objects of Faith, shews the preciousness of this Grace. The Object of Faith, what is it? God himself, nay, in a peculiar manner, God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled, it is God in Christ, it is God manifesting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in his Son, and so God comes to be a more glorious object unto the soul than God taken meerly as he is in himself, the First-being of all things. And except God were an object to Faith, First, he could not be an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the exercise of any other Grace, but in a natural way: as now, if there be not Faith to make God thus to be the object of the soul, if the soul did love God, or fear God, suppose any other grace exercised, if first Faith hath not presented God in this manner, how doth the soul love God? only as the First-Being, and as the Fountain of all Good, and fears God as the great and mighty God of all the World? But now Faith doth present God to the soul as an object in an higher way than otherwise he could be, and so indeed it is Faith that doth form the object for all other Evangelical gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Faith is exercised upon God in a way of a Mystery, not in a Natural way; the object of Faith, it is the Son of God, the Second Person in Trinity, God-man, God reconciling the world unto himself, all the mysteries of the Gospel they are the Objects of FAITH, and the Glorious Counsels of God about Mans Eternal Estate, are the objects of FAITH, <hi>Such things as eye hath never seen, nor ear hath heard, neither can it enter into the heart of man;</hi> that is but a meer man, that hath but Naturals to perceive: These are the things that are the objects of Faith, and indeed till Faith comes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the soul, and presents these glorious objects that are
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:118704:24"/> the most immediate objects of its self, presents them for other graces to work upon, till that time, those that we call graces of Love, and Fear, and Humility, and all those they did but work in a Natural way before: There was a kind of Love, and Fear, and Humility before; but what makes the difference between that love that is but a common grace, or humility a common grace, for there is a kind of love and fear of God, and humility just like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the true saving grace of God; Love, and Fear, and Humility, I say, there is the like to them, yet common graces, and common gifts; but here lies the difference, that before these graces (so we may call them, though but common) they did act upon God in a Natural way; but now Faith doth present God and the mysteries of the Gospel in a supernatural way, in a mysterious way to the soul, so that that love that was acted upon God but meerly as he was the First-Being of all things in a Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral way, now it acts upon God as the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ; before the soul did fear God but only as a great God, and infinitly above him, now the soul doth fear God as he doth reveal those glorious things in his Son, fears God as a Father, with a filial fear, as being reconciled to him in his Son, So that Faith is a precious grace because the objects of it are so precious, and it is that that doth present the objects of all other graces to them in a supernatural way, and indeed doth make their objects to be supernatural to them, therfore a most precious grace is this grace of Faith.</p>

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:118704:25"/> Notions and curious fancies of men, and such kind of thoughts I fear many have of them: Certainly all carnal hearts are possessed with such kind of thoughts of the Kingdom of Heaven; What tell you me of such things? give me House and Land, and let me enjoy an Estate here in this world, and as for these things they are such as are above us; and such kind of reasonings are the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperings of some mens spirits: Oh the poor thoughts that men have of the things of the Kingdom of Heaven before Faith comes into the foul; but when Faith comes into the soul, they are made the most real things of any in the world; the soul comes now to see those blessed and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious things that are revealed in Christ about the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven the most real and substantial of any things in the world, and now is ashamed of those vain conceits that it had of those things heretofore, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the things of the world are but fancies in the hearts of Beleevers: Here's the change that Faith makes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore faith came, the things of the world were substantial, and the things of Heaven were imaginations and fancies; but now when Faith comes, the things of the World they are but fancies, and the things of Heaven they are the substantials, for so the Scripture speaks of the things of the World, that it is but <hi>much fancy;</hi> as it is said of<note place="margin">

Certainly there is no man would have lost the benefit of that he hath seen, and of his present seeing for a whol world (if he were a wise man.) Now if God hath placed such a thing in ones body that shall be of such great use to discover such great things of God unto us as our eyes do, for by our eyes we come to see the wonderful works of God, and much of God comes to be let into the soul by the eye; you that have been abroad and seen the wonderful works of God, Oh how much of God have been let in, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if you have had gracious hear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s, you might have had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of God let into your souls by that which you
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:118704:27"/> have seen with your bodily eyes: But now argue a little from the less to the greater, If such a bodily thing as a mans eye hath so much excellency and preciousness in it, and lets in so much of God to the soul, Oh what doth this Diamond that God puts into the soul! how much doth that let in of God to the soul! Then a man comes to see the wonders of Gods Law and Gospel when God gives him an eye of Faith: And there is the like difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a man that hath not Faith, and another that hath, it is the same difference as if a man were born blind, or were shut up in a Dungeon, and suddenly this mans eyes should be opened, and he should come and see all the great things of God in the world, this man should behold the glory of the Sun; he had heard talk of the shining of the Sun, and of the Heavens, and of the Stars, and Moon, and Seas, and Trees, and Fields, and beautiful things in the World, but alas he knew not what they meant, only he heard people talk of it, and perhaps he could talk what he heard before; but now his eyes are opened, and he comes to behold all these things: Such a kind of change there is in the hearts of men when God doth put Faith into them, they come to have another eye to let in the great things of Christ, and to see them evidently, such an Evidence that the soul is content to venture all that it hath upon it; such an Evidence hath one that hath faith: howsoever other men will not venture any thing for the things of Eternal Life that they hear preached unto them, they will not venture the parting with any one lust, they will not venture the loss of their Estates, if they have but hopes of gaining never so little a matter by any sinful way, they will not venture the loss of their sinful gain, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they look not upon these things as real; but when God puts Faith into the soul, saith the soul, take all, I am content to venture my Estate, my Name, my Liberty, all my Comforts, I am content to venture my Soul, I am content to venture Eternity upon this Word of God that doth reveal such things as these are; here's Faith now, so
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:118704:27"/> that you by this may see that Christians that are never so poor and weak, yet they have the same Faith with those that are the most eminent, and wheras there are some that have excellent parts, learned Doctors that can talk more of Faith and Religion, I but they having not Faith to make the evidence to their souls, they will venture no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; whereas you shall have a poor man or woman that works at their daies labor for their dayly bread, to whom God hath given Faith, they will venture more for God and Jesus Christ than your great Doctors: Here's the preciousness of Faith, <hi>It is the substance of things hoped for, and the evidence of things not seen.</hi> There are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things of God that we have made known by Reason, Faith doth elevate Reason, and discover those things more gloriously to us than Reason could do; therefore the Apostle in speaking of the excellency of Faith, saith in <hi>Heb. 3. 11. Through Faith we understand that the Worlds were framed;</hi> Why do we not understand that without Faith? A man by the light of Nature can know that nothing can be eternal of its self; I but saith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle, by Faith we know that the Worlds were made; as if he should say thus, Indeed there are many things that you know by the eye of Reason, but when you come to have Faith, you shal know in a higher manner than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver you knew before, Faith will give a new light to all things, all things will become new, there will be a new world; as the difference between the light that there is in Heaven (the place of the blessed) and the light that is here in the world, certainly it's different; now we have the light of the world by the Sun, but in the highest Heavens, there's no Sun there, and yet there's light as much as here, and more too, the blessed Saints in Heaven they have light, and yet they have not the light of the Sun there; there's a great deal of difference between that light and the light of the Sun; as thus, In the night season you have a Candle, and you have light then, I but there's a great deal of difference between the light of a Candle,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:118704:28"/> and the light of the Sun: so there is a great deal of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the light of the Sun, and the light of God in the highest Heavens: So there is as much difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the light a man hath to understand things by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and of his understanding things by Faith, he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands the same things; as by the light of a Candle I can, see the same things as I can see by the light of the Sun; and so when I come to Heaven, I may see the same things that I see in the World, as the bodies of the Saints, &amp;c. but with another light, the presence of God doth enlighten the place; so Faith is like that Light that is in Heaven, the place of the blessed that doth discover things by the presence of God, it is but indeed the radiation of the Presence of God to the soul. It is a Speech of <hi>Luther, Faith is a certain beam of the very Divinity that is shed down into the heart of a Beleever, a Beam of the Divinity, that as God in Heaven by his own presence filling that place with the beams of his own Light, makes it a glorious place of Light; so God comes to the soul and fills the soul with his presence by working faith in it, and so makes it full of light; it is a kind of omnipotent thing, and the vertue of it is inestimable and infinite;</hi> so saith <hi>Luther</hi> (who was a man that was acquainted as much with the excellency of Faith as any man that I know of since the Apostles time,) Thus it's evident what a precious thing Faith is: The Application of the Point follows.</p>

                        </gap> is this from my Faith? It's true, that some Faith is higher than others; but know, that the weakest Faith in the world is alike precious, it's of the same nature, though not altogether so glorious, Faith is this precious stone; the difference between this Faith, and the Faith of the most people in the world is as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the precious Diamond, and the common pebble stone that lies in the streets: You that are Marriners, you see what abundance of little stones there are with fine streaks and curious colors that lie upon the Sea shore somtimes among the shels; it may be children if they should come and see such party color'd smooth stones, they would please them; but now a wise man would think these are but common stones, if you should lade your Ships home with such stones as these, what Fraight would you make? you would lose all your Voyage, and be but laugh'd at for your pains.

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:118704:29"/> common gifts: Now when the Lord, that great Lapida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that shall try stones, when he shall come and try it, and find thy supposed Diamond to be but a Bristol stone, for so there are such stones that children will take to be Diamonds, but they are but soft, they have not the hardness that a Diamond hath, and to endure what the Diamond will: Just so I say it is for a man that shall be perswaded that he hath gotten a Diamond, and thinks he is enriched by it, but when it comes to be examined by the skilful Jeweller, he saith, I will not give you two pence for it, Oh how he will be cast down in his spirit! Oh what dejection will there be in the hearts of men and women hereafter that think they have Faith; if thy Faith prove to be this precious Faith, thou art a blessed Creature for ever whatever thou wantest in this world; but if upon examination that thy Faith prove but as a Bristol stone, prove to be too soft, it would be worth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all; it's not enough for a man to say, well, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose my stone be not just a Diamond, yet is somwhat neer one, and therefore I hope I may have half the price of a Diamond: No, either it must be a right Diamond, or else it is not worth more than an ordinary common stone; so though your Faith should come to be never so neer the true Faith, never so like it, if it should come so neer it as to prove to be the Faith of miracles, at the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it would not be worth two pence to you; Oh ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you had need look to this Precious Faith that you do not content your selves with the common faith of the World that you may find in every high way; for a man to have Faith, and he can swear by it, it's a sign he doth not account it Precious, that he will pawn it upon every action: If a man had a Diamond worth ten thousand pounds, would he pawn it upon every trifle? upon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very word? Thou knowest not the worth of thy Faith.</p>
                     <p>I shall lay down this one thing for a Note to try whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther your Faith be true or no, <hi>Certainly the Faith that is this Precious Faith, God in some measure makes the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:118704:29"/> soul to have a right knowledg of its own self:</hi> I mean thus, The soul that thinks it hath Faith (it's true, some may have it and not know it) but if a man or woman doth say, I hope I have got this Precious Faith, if thou canst say thou hopest thou hast it, then certainly this wil be, Thou canst not but esteem of this more than if God had given thee more than ten thousand worlds for thy Portion, Oh then thou seest the infinite riches of the Grace of God towards thy soul in this, then God hath learned thee to admire at his infinite goodness to thee, that he should give thee this infinite Precious Grace of Faith; God doth not give Faith as if a man should give a Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond into the hands of a fool or child, but if he gives a Diamond, he will say, now look to it, here's a Diamond that may make you a rich man for ever, and therefore look to it that you may improve it: so whensoever God gives this Precious Faith to the soul, he doth give it so when once it is discovered to the soul, for all the while it is not discovered, there Gods hand is upon it, and keeps it safe that the soul shall not lose it; but when Gods hand comes to discover it to the soul, he saith, see to it, here's that which you must live upon, here's that which mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>XI. And yet further, Faith is Precious in this, <hi>That as it quickens up all, and inlivens all, so it's that which doth put a dignity upon all the Works of the Saints:</hi> Faith doth Nobilitate any work that the children of God do, and makes all to be acceptable unto God: You know what's said of the Faith of <hi>Abel,</hi> in <hi>Hebrews,</hi> 11. you may read there the large Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Faith, <hi>And by Faith▪</hi> Abel <hi>did offer a Sacrifice more acceptable than that of</hi> Cain: What was that which made the Sacrifice of <hi>Abel</hi> more acceptable than <hi>Cain</hi>'s? It was Faith: So a man that is not a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever, perhaps may do a thing that for the matter of it may be as good as a Beleever doth; I but this is not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of before thou beest a Beleever, all that thou dost is rejected by God, it is rejected in order to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life, the Lord doth not accept of what is done, so as to accept of thee for life; he cannot be well pleased with what's done, it's true, there may be somwhat done that may take away some hindrance of the work of Faith, but to say that God is well pleased with thee, it cannot be until thou beest a Beleever; it may be that that may be less sin, and materially good, and so it's thy duty to do it, howsoever do not say, What shall we do nothing then, being Unbeleevers? Thou must do whatsoever God requires of thee, it's materially good; but take all together, and thou canst not be said to please God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Faith; saith the Scripture, <hi>Without Faith it's im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to please God,</hi> not only thou dost not please
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:118704:36"/> God, but it's impossible; thou thinkest that if thou hast good meanings and good desires, and thou art sorry for what thou hast done, and thou comest to Church and hearest the Word, and art just in thy dealings with men (and the like) this doth not please God without Faith, it's not possible for thee to please God: Do not tell me what thou dost, but what's the Principle that thou dost these by; thou mayest live better than thou hast done, ther may be many things in thy actions mended; but yet if thy state and condition be not changed by being brought into Jesus Christ, that which thou doest is not accepted, it's Faith puts an acceptation upon that we do: <hi>Luther</hi> hath such an expression concerning Faith (he that had so much himself, and therefore admires it so much the more) saith he, <hi>The actions of the poorest Milk-maid, the poo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest Servant, are more glorious than all that</hi> Alexander, <hi>or</hi> Julius Caesar, <hi>or those famous Conquerors that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered almost all the world; the actions of the poorest Servant but milking a Cow, or sweeping a house, is more honorable in the eyes of God▪ than those were, if these Servants be Beleevers, and do what they do out of Faith, it is more honorable because it is out of Faith:</hi> For so Faith doth not only set the soul on work to close with God, but sets it on work to perform all things, and thy duties are accepted of God, and they are a sweet sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor in the nostrils of God, that broken Prayer of thine, though thou art not able in words to express thy self, but by breathing and panting out thy heart to God, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from Faith, it's more accepted than all the glorious works that all the Hypocrites in the world do, or possibly can do; it's Faith that brings acceptation not only to our persons, but actions, it <hi>ingraciates</hi> a person and his duties at the Throne of Grace; and that's a precious Grace: Is not that worth a world that shall make our poor, mean, low, nothing-services that we tender up to God to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of him; this is only by the grace of Faith.</p>

                     <p n="3">3 <hi>It's Faith that doth raise above all discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;</hi> that's the Grace that doth it, and carries the soul through all kind of difficulties: There's many things comes in the way of the soul to discourage it, it may be Sence saith it cannot be; and Reason saith, how can it possibly be? and the World saith, it shall not be; but Faith comes and saith, it shall be: after Reason hath concluded against it, and Sence hath concluded against it, and all the World hath concluded against a thing, saith Faith, I but, for all this, it shall be done. It keeps up the head above water in the midst of waves and tempests though the body be under: Oh the Saints of God in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times had discouragements enough had they not been
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:118704:38"/> kept up by Faith, which we shal shew more cleerly here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. Take both these in the example of that Father; What discouragement might <hi>Abraham</hi> have had in the offering up of his Son, especially that great discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, what shall become of the Promise of God? well saith <hi>Abraham</hi> to his Servants, I and the lad will go yonder, stay you here, and I and the lad will go and come again; why <hi>Isaac</hi> was to be sacrificed and burnt to ashes, and yet saith <hi>Abraham,</hi> I and the lad will come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; as if <hi>Abraham</hi> should say to <hi>Isaac,</hi> I must have you to be burnt to ashes, but yet I must come again with the lad; and in this child all the Nations in the World must be blessed, God hath promised and though he be burnt to ashes yet he must come again, <hi>Faith will bring a live</hi> Isaac <hi>out of the ashes;</hi> and it's a sign that people are not acquainted with this Heroical Grace of Faith that are so presently discouraged with every little thing, if they meet with a work that is but a little difficult they give over; Faith will break through difficulties, as that in the 11. to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> about the 34. verse, and afterwards you may see what difficulties thousands did break through by their Faith; let the means be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so smal that God would have us to use, though the means come never so much under the thing we use the means for, yet Faith will carry it through, and indeed it is so much the more glorious by how much the weaker the means are, and therefore that's observable in the 11. of the <hi>Hebrews:</hi> You shall find in <hi>Joshua</hi>'s Faith, that by Faith he did pull down the walls of <hi>Jerico:</hi> Now somtimes I have wondered with my self why it is that <hi>Joshua</hi> having Faith at one time to cause the Sun to stand still in the Firmament, but when the Holy Ghost commends his faith, he doth not say that the Sun stood still in the Firmament, but by Faith the walls of <hi>Jerico</hi> fell down; I cannot think of any other reason but this, Because that was an extraordinary work; yet <hi>Joshua</hi> had to deal with God in it in an extraordinary manner
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:118704:39"/> indeed there, and it was a sudden work of God in raising of his heart to such a Faith: but that of <hi>Jerico,</hi> it was a thing that had more discouragements, as no work could have the like; as could any conceive that here's a strong City that had strong walls, and these must fall to the ground; How? He must have a company of Priests to go toating and blowing round about the walls, and this must be the means to bring down the walls of the City; certainly those in <hi>Jerico</hi> could not but laugh at them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was a thing so contrary to sense, and such a poor weak means: but the Faith of <hi>Joshua</hi> is commended so much the more, as if God should say, well, my servant <hi>Joshua,</hi> when I set him about such a work that was so difficult, and all the means he had was but a few Rams horns to do it, and yet he goes on by Faith and beleeves it, and at length got down the walls of <hi>Jerico:</hi> So when God sets us about great, works, if means fail, or if they seem to come too short, yet Faith will carry through all; and this is the honor of it, and if by Faith we can be carried through a work, when the means is weak, and poor, and mean; Oh this is that which God accounts to be honorable, it's the glory of Faith to do this.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 And Faith what can it do? you say, <hi>It will rejoyce in tribulations, and knows how to make up all our wants in God himself;</hi> let afflictions be never so great, it knows how to rejoyce, it can see day through a little crevis: in <hi>Rom. 5. We rejoyce in tribulations;</hi> other men may be patient in tribulations, but Faith makes us to rejoyce, and toglory in tribulations; they are an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred degrees further than Patience; it's not enough for a Beleever to be patient in tribulations, but to rejoyce and glory in tribulations, to be exceeding glad.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 Do you say what can it do? <hi>It can overcome the World: This is our victory, even our Faith, whereby we overcome the World,</hi> saith the Apostle; it lifts the Beleever above all the things in the world, above the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor, frowns, and fears of the world; it overcomes the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:118704:39"/> world, not only because it keeps the world from doing it mischief, but it can make use of the world for it's own good; we are more than conquerers through Christ.</p>
                     <p n="6">6 Would you know what Faith can do? <hi>It can look upon the face of the holy and just God with joy, and upon the face of death, and of judgment with joy:</hi> let God appear in his infinite Holiness and Justice before the soul, yet by Faith the soul can be enabled to look upon the face of the holy and righteous God with joy: Oh how precious is this Grace of Faith, and as we go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long we may see that certainly the Faith of the greatest part of the world is not true Faith, the ordinary common Faith is not this true Faith; we may have ordinary stones in the street, but this Jewel is a rare thing. There are divers things yet that I intended for the opening a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more of the preciousness of this Grace.</p>

                        </gap>o much honor as by Faith; therefore it is said of <hi>Abraham</hi> in <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. Abraham <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved and glorified God,</hi> he glorified God in beleeving; hence it is that Christ tels us that this is the work that God would have us to do, even your Faith, to beleeve, this is
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:118704:40"/> the great work of all, that which brings glory unto God more than any thing else, and the truth is, there's nothing glorifies God but beleeving; and other graces as they have the vertue and excellency of Faith in them, so they glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie Gods Name, Faith gives glory to God in a peculiar way, it gives God the glory of many of his attributes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, it gives him the glory of his Truth and Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, God stands much upon the glory of those, it gives him the glory of his Power by resting upon him, and the glory of his Mercy, these three Attributes especially. It's a great honor that's put upon God, and the soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worship that the Creature is able to worship God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, for a soul to cast its self, and to venture its self for all its present good, and eternal good upon a meer word of God, though it sees nothing else for it, yea, though it see many things making against it, yet if it hath but once a word, it can venture its eternal estate upon that word; this is a mighty Honor that is given to God: A man would account himself much honored if a man should venture his life and his estate upon a mans meer word, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a mans faithfulness, that if so be that he should fail him, it were as much as his life were worth: Why God accounts himself exceedingly honored in this, when thou canst rest thy soul upon his meer faithfulness, that in the midst of temptations and of all tryals and oppositions, yet thou canst venture thy soul upon him, and canst say, though he kill me, yet will I trust in him. Many poor Christians, they are afraid to beleeve; they are not afraid to go to Prayer and hear the Word, and walking in the duties of obedience to other Commandements, but when they come to beleeve they are afraid to beleeve; why art thou afraid to do that which God accounts the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test glory to his Name of all the things that thou canst do? God is not so well pleased in any action that thou canst do, as in the action of casting thy soul upon him, and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing thy eternal estate upon his free Promise.</p>
                     <p>And it's a special honoring of God in this, because by
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:118704:40"/> the grace of Faith God attains that which his special de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign is for the magnifying of, his own Name; what is the great design that God hath in the world but the magnify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the riches of his free grace? that's that which God aims at above all; it's true, if God will have a world, he must put forth his Almighty Power to make this World, and if he will have a world he must order and guide things in the world to keep them from confusion, there he mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies his wisdom, and he must preserve his Creatures if he means to have a World continue any time; and here he magnifies his goodness: I but there is a further design that God hath in making of the World; it is, That he might have some of his Creatures to all eternity magnify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the riches of his free Grace; that's the great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, and all the other things that ever God did do here in this World, are some way or other in order to this; but the top of all that which God aimed at in making the World, is that he might have some Creatures that might magnifie the riches of his free Grace to all Eternity. Now what Grace in the heart of man doth serve so immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately for the magnifying of Gods free grace as the grace of Faith? and how doth God attain to the glory of this design of his, but by Faith? that's the Grace that lifts up the glory of Gods free grace in his Son; and therefore it's precious, because of all Graces it is that which glorifies God: and did Christians but understand this, were they but convinc'd of this, they would be as much afraid of Unbeleef as any other sin, you would (I say) fear the sin of Unbeleef, as well as fear the sin of Theft, or of Swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, or Blaspheming, or Murder, or Adultery. If there should be a temptation to Adultery, or Uncleanness, or Blasphemy, your hearts would tremble at it, why? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause you think these are great dishonors to God: now when there comes a temptation to Unbeleef, your hearts should shake as much at that; for if Faith be the great Grace that doth glorifie God, then Unbeleef is the great Sin that doth dishonor God in the World.</p>

                     <p>The Reason is this:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Adam</hi> had Grace given to him by God, and the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple▪ of his life was put into him, he had the Principle of his Spiritual life in him; as a watch hath the Springs put in it to move, so <hi>Adams</hi> Graces were put into him, as the Principle of his life: But now a Christian hath Grace put into him as <hi>Adam</hi> had, but the Principle of his life it is still in another, in Jesus Christ his head that he is united to by Faith, and Faith is the Grace where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:118704:41"/> the soul goes out of it self to fetch a Principle of life and lives upon a Principle of life out of its self, but lives in its Head Christ, and so it's not out of its self, that is out of the same mystical body, but out of its self, out of its own soul.</p>
                     <p>Faith doth not only fetch life from Christ at first, but it is the Grace▪ that continually fetches life from Jesus Christ the Head; and hence it is that by Faith the state of a Christian comes to be better than the state of <hi>Adam</hi> was in Innocency before ever he sinned against God: This is a Precious Grace, whereby we come not only to be united to the Fountain and Root of Life, but where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we come to fetch a continual supply of Life, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore certainly a Christian cannot perish, because that now he lives by a Principle of life that is without himself, in Christ, and he hath this Grace put into him to fetch life continually from him.</p>

THe last thing of all that shews the precious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of this Grace of Faith is this, <hi>That it is the only Condition of the Second Covenant: So God loved the World that he sent forth his only begotten Son, that whosoever beleeved should not perish, but have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting Life:</hi> The Condition of the first Covenant was, <hi>Do this and live;</hi> the Condition of the Second Covenant, it is, <hi>Beleeve and Live:</hi> Faith is the only Condition of the Second Covenant, therefore it is that which doth interest the soul in all the rich treasures, that there are in the second Covenant: Now all the good of a Christian consists in the benefit of the Second Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant;
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:118704:42"/> whatsoever riches a Christian hath, it is a fruit of the Second Covenant, it comes from that, all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of a Saint is in the Covenant of Grace that God hath made with him: now it is Faith only that is the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Second Covenant that God hath made with the soul in Jesus Christ, he requires nothing as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of it, all the works of preparation that there are before, are not at all the condition of the Second Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, no nor the works of Sanctification are not the conditions of it; the works of Preparation are only such things as without which we cannot come to have Faith; as thus, We cannot have Faith but we must come to know what Christ is, and we must know that Christ is a Savior, and from what he saves us; and we must be sensible of them, and not only know them, but be affected with them: these are things that do necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily go before Faith, but not as any conditions. Works of Preparation are not the condition of the Second Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and works of Sanctification are the condition of a justified person, but not the condition of Justification, not the condition of the Covenant that God hath made with us in Christ, rather the fruits of the Covenant than the condition of it: all the works of Sanctification they flow from the Covenant, and Faith that's the Grace that is the condition of it, and God uses this Grace to be the condition of the Second Covenant, because hereby God doth manifest more the glory of his free Grace than before, because the Creature may not boast, because the Covenant may be free, therefore it is that God hath cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen Faith to be the condition of the Covenant because it may be free; if so be that God had chosen other Graces, it would not have been so free as by choosing Faith, for other graces are graces that are indeed the renewal of that which <hi>Adam</hi> had in Innoceney at first, the Image of God that <hi>Adam</hi> had there, but Faith doth but go out of it self to another, that's the proper Grace of Faith, and therefore this doth shew the freeness of the Covenant of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:118704:42"/> Grace, more than if other graces had been the condition of the Covenant; Faith, it's but the hand to receive, it's not the condition of the Covenant so as works were before in <hi>Adam,</hi> for this now is not the condition as a work nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; it's one of the meanest works in its self, take it in its own nature, its that which doth abase man as much as any thing that is, it is a Grace whereby man goes out of himself for all his good, and receives it of another, but the excellency consists in this, In that it is an Instrument to fetch so much good to the soul; there lies the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of it: so that it is a condition, but not a condition meerly as it is a work in its self, but as an instrument that God hath appointed to fetch in from Jesus Christ, so it comes to be the condition of the Covenant, and this is most sutable to a Covenant of free Grace, the most su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table condition that possibly could be; and hence it is that God would have this to be the condition of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant because it is sure, it could not have been so sure if other Graces had been the condition of it, because other Graces could not assure the heart of that perfect Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness to stand before an infinite, just, and holy God, so as this can do; other Graces if they be weak, and have imperfections in them, the soul is presently at a stand, and knows not what to do, how can they be fit to be ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered up to an infinite holy God? but now Faith, though it be never so weak and imperfect the soul needs not be at stand because of this, because it's a hand to fetch in that which is perfect; now a weak hand may receive a rich Jewel as well as a strong hand, a weak hand cannot work so well as a strong hand, but a weak hand can take a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious thing as wel as a strong hand; now therfore I say the Covenant is more sure, becaus Faith is the condition of it, for though it be never so weak, yet this is the proper work to fetch and receive in a perfect Righteousness.</p>
                     <p>And the soul is not liable to so many temptations if it understand things aright upon the knowledg of Faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the condition of the Covenant, as when it appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:118704:43"/> other graces to be the condition of the Covenant; as thus, Many that are weak, and not understanding aright the Covenant of Grace, they do think indeed that God will have mercy upon them, that is, if they were so deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from their corruptions, and have so much Power a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their sins, or if they were able to perform duties in such and such a manner, then they think God would have mercy upon them, and it is very Natural to a man to think that God will have mercy upon him, upon no other terms but upon his obedience, and his duties, and upon his corruptions that he doth overcome; I say, this is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry natural, why? because it was once the condition of the Covenant God dealt with <hi>Adam</hi> in a Natural way sutable to a rational Creature, the first Covenant, and the condition of it was that which was sutable to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a rational Creature, and so God dealt with him in a Natural way: now men that are yet natural, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:118704:44"/> The Consideration of this Point is a matter of exceeding Comfort to all the people of God, to all Beleevers up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whom the Lord hath bestowed this Precious Faith; perhaps the Lord hath not bestowed upon you Gold or Silver, and given you Jewels to hang about your necks to adorn you as others have; I but he hath given you this Jewel of Faith, and indeed this is instead of all, all Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are comprehended in this Jewel of Faith, and many a poor man or woman that God gives but little of outward things, yet in giving them Faith the Lord makes such a one to be rich; hence in the second chapter of <hi>James,</hi> the fift verse, <hi>Hearken, my beloved Brethren;</hi> as a thing that should comfort the hearts of poor people, as a thing of wonder, and of great comfort, <hi>Hearken, my beloved Brethren,</hi> so I say to you that are poor in the world, and have little of the riches of the world, hearken to this consolation, <hi>Hath not God chosen you that are poor to be rich in Faith?</hi> Suppose God had given you all the riches of the World and denied you this Pearl, you had been a miserable Creature without it, but certainly this makes you happy, it's better than all, and by this thou mayest have a supply of all; do but consider of these Particulars in this use of Comfort. This precious Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el of Faith, it's instead of all Riches, it's better than all the Riches in the world, it's that which gives thee right to all the Riches of the World, and it's that whereby thou mayest have a supply of all things according to thy neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, and thou needest not fear any evil, for thou hast that within thee that may help against any kind of evil that thou conceivest thy self to be in danger of.

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:118704:44"/> in that they have such a Jewel as this is.</p>
                     <p>Use 3. <hi>Of Encouragement.</hi> Further, It may be a mighty Encouragement to all those that are seeking after this Grace of Faith, when they hear what a precious Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el this Grace is: Is there any one whose heart the Lord hath begun to strike, that now he is seeking after to get Faith? they see the breach that sin hath made between God and their souls, and they hear that God hath made a gracious Covenant of Life and Salvation to Beleevers, and they think with themselves, Oh that they had Faith, Oh that we were but sure that we had Faith, and now thou art seeking after it, and wouldest give a thousand worlds if thou hadst them at thy dispose, so that thou wert sure that thou hadst this Grace of Faith; it may be thou hast been seeking long, and thou hast not abilities yet to beleeve, be not discouraged in seeking it; though God makes thee wait for it a long time in seeking after it, for it's worth the seeking, if thou canst have it at last thou art a made-man for ever, thou hearest how precious it is, and therefore do not grudg thy pains and thy labor that thou art put upon in seeking after this Grace of Faith: Consider what a deal of labor men take in see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king after Pearls, they go to the uttermost parts of the Earth, and into places where they endanger their lives by the extremity of the heat, and compass the world up and down to enrich themselves with Pearls and precious Stones? Certainly then thou that art seeking for this Pearl, as the Merchant that we read of in <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 45. he was seeking for goodly Pearls, and at length he found a Pearl of great price, and went and fold all that he had and bought it: it's true, Jesus Christ is the Pearl, and Faith is the next, because by Faith we come to have our interest in Jesus Christ, and if thou be willing to part with all, that thou mightest have this Pearl, and so the other, though thou art a longtime under the Spirit of Bondage, and endurest much trouble of conscience for many yeers together, yet if God be all this while in a way of working

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> morning,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:118704:46"/> or neglect some other opportunity, how do you know but that might be the morning that God might intend to give unto you this Precious Stone: Many have come somtimes accidentally to hear the Word, and the Lord hath wrought this excellent Grace of Faith in them, that they would not for ten thousand worlds have been with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and therefore do not neglect, but wait at Wisdoms gates, and though God works not in one Sermon, he may work in another, and therefore let it be your care to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend upon the Word, and to attend for this very end, that God might work Faith: Lord, thou hast said it, that Faith comes by hearing, and this is a most precious Grace, Oh that my soul might have it when I come to hear thy Word, it's the very end that I might have Faith wrought by hearing, I come not to hear meerly, and to know what such a man can say about such a Point, but come to that very end that God might work Faith in my soul: Oh how just might it be with God that those peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple should perish eternally without Faith, that will not attend upon the means for obtaining of Faith: If you will sit at home sluggish, and be buired about base and vile things when others of Gods Servants are hearing the Word; Oh when you shall come upon your death beds, and then come to cry to God for the pardon of your sins, and for Faith, Oh how just were it with God to deny it you. <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, A Second Rule is this, When you do come to hear the Word, you must hear every Truth as that which doth infinitely concern your souls, and your Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Estates; come with such a disposition, for indeed that's the reason why people have not Faith, and why they do not beleeve, because when they come to hear, they do not come to hear things as meerly concerning themselves; as now, if a man be telling of a story, if I think that that which this man tells is a thing not much concerning me, I do not so much mind it as to give credit to it, but if I hear a thing that doth meerly concern my
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:118704:46"/> self, then I weigh it, and ponder it, and am easily brought to beleeve it, why? because it is that which doth so neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concern my self: So whatsoever Truths you hear, know that they do concern your lives, and therefore weigh and ponder them, and by this God doth work Faith in the soul, for God works it in us (though in a supernatural way) yet he works it in us as Rational Creatures.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The Third Rule is, When you come to hear the Word, though you cannot find abilities to close with it as you should do, yet do but lay up this thought in your minds, consider if this should prove to be true, I hear such and such things in the Word about the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of Jesus Christ, and of Faith, and Eternal Life, and the glory of Heaven, and such things as these are, indeed I have not Faith enough to see into the reality of these things; I but, what if these things should prove to be true? were I not a most miserable man to lose all this glory of Heaven that I hear of, for the enjoyment of some base sinful lust?</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, The Fourth Rule is, If so be that you would have God work Faith (being it's the gift of God) ad Prayer to your Hearing; both before you come prepare by Prayer, and when you hear a Truth that hath any excellency in it, dart up your hearts to God, and with a secret ejaculation pray to God that he would cause that Truth to sink into your hearts, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards pray over that Truth of God you hear when you are got home, and then it may be Faith may come; we find it by experience, many hear Truths an hundred times, and yet they have not Faith to close with them, but at length God pleaseth to dart them with that power into their hearts, that they cannot but receive them.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, The Fift Rule is, Do not give liberty to your selves to please your Sences too much; you know that place in <hi>Jude, Sensual not having the Spirit;</hi> men that are sensual, they have not the Spirit of God to work
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:118704:47"/> Faith in the soul, and there's nothing hinders the work of God more than Sence, men that will please their Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and Gluttons, and unclean persons, and those that give up themselves to live by sence, no marvel though they have not Faith brought into their souls, Sence is a mighty enemy to Faith, <hi>We walk by Faith, and not by Sence,</hi> saith the Apostle, therefore take heed of Sensual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, be willing to beat down your body, and not please your Sences too much, and that will be a way for you to get Faith in your souls.</p>
                     <p>Sixtly, The Sixt Rule, You must not only deny Sence, but you must deny your own Reason too: take heed of attributing too much to your own apprehension, do not therefore cast off a Truth of God because you cannot understand it, I do not see the Reason of it, and I cannot understand how it should be, and so to reject it, Oh take heed of that I beseech you: <hi>Luther</hi> hath such a Speech, <hi>Mans corrupt Reason, it's a terrible enemy to Faith, Faith hath no greater enemy</hi> (saith he) <hi>than the corrupt Reason of man, and this is the ground why many great Scholers are left of God:</hi> and our Savior saith in <hi>Matth. 11. I thank thee O Father, Lord of Heaven and Earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes:</hi> the wise of the world, they stick upon their own Reason, and their own conceits, and now God confounds the wisdom of the world, God hath so ordered things in his Word, that the necessary things of Eternal Life in the Gospel, they should be altogether above Reason, and those that stick so much upon their own Reason, and own Natural Parts, they come to be offended with the things of the Gospel; they are ready to say as <hi>Nicodemus</hi> did when Christ told him of the new Birth, <hi>How can these things be?</hi> Here's the ground why those that are poor, are rich in Faith, why? Because they are poor and weak in their Natural Parts, and therefore they stick not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> much to their own Reason, and they are more capable
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:118704:47"/> Subjects for God to work Faith upon, than others that stick so much to their own parts: Many that have wit and parts, they are ready to scorn the Truths of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel that come in plainness and simplicity, as the Scholers in <hi>Athens</hi> did <hi>Pauls</hi> plain preaching▪ Jesus Christ; but God hath so ordered on purpose that it might be a stumbling block to those, as Christ crucified was to the Jews.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, The last Rule is this, If you would have God to work Faith, this precious Faith in your hearts, do not sin against that Historical Faith that God hath given you: there's many, though they have not this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Faith, yet they have another kind of Faith, God hath gone on so far in their souls, that he hath convinc'd them of the Truth of the Scriptures, though they have not Faith to unite their hearts to Jesus Christ, yet they have so much Faith to beleeve the most things that the Minister speaks is true; Oh take heed of sinning against your Historical Faith, if you would ever come to have Justifying Faith; many a man comes to hear the Word, and he doth beleeve that those that walk thus &amp; thus, shal not inherit eternal Life; now many go away, and they sin against the very light of their own consciences, and upon that God leaves their souls for ever in Unbeleef, that they shall never come to have justifying Faith to unite their souls to Jesus Christ; observe this Rule whenever God doth convince your souls of any one Truth in his Word, go away and charge this Truth upon your souls, Oh Lord, thou hast convinc'd me of this Truth, and I dare not sin against it; now such a soul that dares not do so, such a soul is not far from the Kingdom of Heaven, though you cannot work this precious Faith in your own souls, you need not wil fully go and sin against any light that God puts into your hearts; those that sin against the light of conscience, it's just with God to deny to them this precious Faith that might save their souls.</p>

                     <p>It's the ordinary way of Christians, and yet certainly a deceitful way, it's that which the Devil doth exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly trouble Christians withal, That when God expects that they should put forth their Faith, the main thing that they do, it is to spend the strength of their spirits a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout those things that do but weaken their Faith, take heed of this I beseech you, and seeing God hath given you this Faith, make use of it upon all occasions, and the reason because of this Second Point, I am but poor and weak, it's true, for those that are eminent in Faith, they may when tryals and temptations comes, they may put forth their Faith.</p>

                     <p>Secondly, And further, <hi>Thy Faith doth justifie thee as well, nay, justifies thee as much as the Faith of</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Isaac, <hi>and</hi> Jacob; for though there may be diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in Sanctification, for a weak Faith doth not san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie as much as a strong Faith, but it justifies as much as a strong Faith: what hath God made me like and equal with them in the point of Justification, had not I need labor to be as like then as I can in the point of Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation?
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:118704:49"/> that's the main upon which my Eternal Estate doth depend, the pardon of sin, and the saving of my soul, therefore it's like precious Faith with them.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, And further, <hi>Thy Faith doth as truly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest thee in God, and unite thee to Jesus Christ as the strongest Faith in the world;</hi> it doth as truly make thee one with Jesus Christ, and God to be thy portion, and the Word to be thy Inheritance, as the strongest Faith.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>And thy Faith doth as truly bring thee to such Priviledges to be a child of God▪ and an Heir:</hi> thou art as truly an Heir to life and Salvation as ever <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> was, and thy Faith doth as truly Sanctifie thee, as the Faith of the strongest, though not so much.</p>
                     <p>Fiftly, <hi>And thy Faith doth as truly interest thee in the Covenant as the Faith of the strongest:</hi> thou art as truly brought into the Covenant as <hi>David,</hi> or <hi>Daniel,</hi> or any of those eminent ones were, and thy Faith is of as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting a Nature as the Faith of the strongest, of such a Nature as shall never fail as wel as the faith of the stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest, I mean by everlasting, that it brings thee into such a condition as thou shalt never fall off from Jesus Christ; Oh thou thinkest that those that have strong Faith what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever temptations comes▪ they may keep close to Christ, and shall never fall off, be of good comfort every Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver that hath but the least dram of true Faith, thou art as sure not to be rent from Jesus Christ as ever <hi>Abraham</hi> or any of the Apostles were, it is as impossible for thee to be rent from Jesus Christ by the Devil, as <hi>Abraham</hi> or <hi>Paul,</hi> or any of the Apostles, and thou art as sure to come to Heaven as any of those.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> I but you will say, <hi>This thing will be a means to make people then to be slothful and sluggish, if the least degree of Faith will do all these things as truly as the strongest, then what great matter is it whether we have weak Faith, or strong Faith? we may come to Heaven if we have but weak Faith?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Oh! such a reasoning is unworthy of a Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:118704:50"/> why, hast thou thy Faith only for thine own ends, because thy sin may be pardoned, and thou mayest come to Heaven? is that all the preciousness of thy Faith? thou didst hear that thy Faith was precious, because that it did enable thee to give glory to God, &amp;c. In these things thou mayest be equal with other of Gods people, but thou canst not bring so much glory to God as one that hath a strong Faith can.</p>
                     <p>2 And a strong Faith will bring a great deal more comfort than a weak Faith; and though a weak Faith may bring to Heaven, yet with a great deal of difficulty it wil bring you to Heaven: As in your Ships, would any man reason after that manner, I have seen a poor tatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Ship that hath had all the Sails rent in pieces, and the Masts been broken with storms and tempests, yet it hath gotten with much ado to the Haven, and hath not been sunk, would a man say, no matter for my Sails, and no matter for my Masts, I may possibly get to the Haven, is there not a great deal of difference between that Ship and another with all its Top-Gallants up, and all the Sails spreading, and with much safety and ease? this is a great deal better: Just so is this, like to Christians going to Heaven; there's many Saints that have but a little Faith, and temptations rends, and tears, and pulls them, and they are afraid every wave and billow will swallow them up, and somtimes they are up, and somtimes they are down, and yet God with his Almighty Power, at length brings them to Heaven: but there are other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians that comes with their full Sails to Heaven, wind and tyde on their side, and overpowers all temptations that comes in their way, and is not this a more glorious sight to see a Christian go with full Sails to Heaven, and let whatsoever difficulties or temptations come in the way, he can bear them all down; you shall have other Christians that are continually doubting and fearing, and yet may have that Faith that may bring them to Heaven, but that dishonors God much, and blemisheth their holy
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:118704:50"/> profession; but others live above themselves and above the world, and so they do glorifie God, and glorifie their Profession: You that have weak Faith you will be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to stumble upon every thing; as a weakly man, he will be ready to stumble at every thing, but a strong man he can go on and not stumble; so a weak Faith will be ready to stumble at every thing, but a strong Faith will not, and therefore let not that reasoning be amongst you.</p>

                        <p>The next Use is thus, If the Faith of the weakest be the same with the strongest, then there is nothing that we reade in Scripture that any Beleever did, but every one should labor to get to the height that they did: You will say, all cannot do alike: But what hinders? their Faith was as weak as thine, how did they get up so high to suffer such great things as they did? it was the truth of their Faith carried them through more than flesh and blood could effect, and their Faith being true, by using means they got up to those degrees; and seeing thy Faith is of the same stamp, why mayest thou not get up to the same degrees? their hearts were at first as naught as thine, and no better before they had Faith, if their hearts were better after, it was by Faith that they bettered them, and they had but the same means, nay certainly, you that live in the noon-day of the Gospel Light, have far greater means than those you read of in that Chapter which is a little Book of Martyrs: You are troubled, and are ready to think you have engaged your selves too far in the Cause of God, because you are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of your Estates to be taken away from you: you may see by Faith that they were carried to wander up and down in Sheeps Skins, and Goats Skins, in Leather Britches and Doublets, being destitute, afflicted, tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and yet they continued in their excellency still, their Faith made them so precious, <hi>that the world was not worthy of them,</hi> and they did not only live in faith, but they died in Faith, and they obtained a good report: Now I appeal to your consciences, can you think that any of those that the Apostle speaks of there, had the like
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:118704:52"/> means of the revelation of Jesus Christ, that you have? for they had not any one thing that is written in the new Testament, for they lived in the time of the <hi>Machabees,</hi> and indeed the worst times of all, for the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Be not discouraged, for you know not what Faith will do, it was nothing but Faith that carryed these Christians through the worst of times, and the greatest of Sufferings: Oh, but their hearts were not so bad as my heart, if they were not, it was only Faith that did make them better, they had not like precious means as you have, and therefore God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects that your like precious Faith must do and suffer great things if called as they were thereunto.</p>

That place in <hi>James,</hi> 2. at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning is remarkable, <hi>My Brethren, have not the Faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons:</hi> There are some that do refer Glory to Faith there, and indeed the Original is not against it; My Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, <hi>of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> with respect of persons: [The Lord] there, you may see is written in other Letters; it is not in the Greek, but only the Translators put that word in to make up the sence, therefore the words are to be read thus, <hi>My Brethren, have not the Faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, of Glory in respect of persons:</hi> now this may be referred to Faith, as if he should say, if there be any that hath <hi>Faith,</hi> he hath <hi>Glory,</hi> for he is a member of Jesus Christ. And again, Have not the glorious Faith of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ in respect of Persons; if there be any degree of Faith, it is glorious and precious Faith, have it not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of persons: <hi>Paul</hi> that was so strong in faith, how doth he cry to the Romans: Oh! <hi>Paul</hi> saw that he had need of the Romans, as we know little chips will kindle great blocks, and so many Christians that have great strength and great parts, yet your weak Christians, they many times put life and quickening into their hearts, and

It is said of <hi>Bucer,</hi> that if he could see any thing of Christ in a man, <hi>aliquid Christi,</hi> that alone was the Load-stone of his Love: It is a most miserable and horrible sign of Gods displeasure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst us, that if there be but any difference in opinion one from another, Christians are so estranged that they make no use of one anothers Graces; But till we come to learn this, though we be of different Judgments and Opinions, yet still to make use of one anothers Graces, questionless things will never be well if men speak of divisions, and say the world will never do well so long as there are so many Opinions, and there must be a course taken to bring all men to one way; certainly this is a mistake, this is a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Principle to think that there can be no peace with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out uniformity in Worship; but this is the Principle that will cause peace, that is, Though there be divers waies of divers Opinions, and of different Judgments, yet they have all one Faith, and let us make use of one anothers Graces, and have communion one with another though there be not the like Opinion, and the like way; this will cause peace in Churches, and in Common-wealths, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the other will never do it; for certainly the Judgments of men cannot be forced; but when there is walking in love and peace one with another, that's the way to bring one another to their Judgments, and not by keeping at a
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:118704:54"/> distance one from another: A sight of the different waies of people, makes some dream that one shall go to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven one way, and another another way; No my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, there is but one Faith, and therefore look what the carriages of Gods people were in former times, they are the same now: You shall observe it, a Christian that lives in one place, and he hath occasion perhaps to travel forty or fifty miles, and he meets with a godly gracious heart that (it may be) he never saw before in his life; but by that time they have been half an hour together, their hearts closes together, and they find the very same spirit in them. As it is observed in Instruments of Musick, let one string of a Lute be raised up to one height, the other to the same, lay a straw upon one and touch the other, and that which hath the straw upon it, that simpathizes with it, and the straw will shake and fall off, meerly with the consent of the other string that is just of the same kind: So it is with the hearts of Gods people, because their Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are all the same and doth simpathize one with another, and one closes with another, and joyns sweetly together; as you shall observe it in wicked men, there is the very same spirit of wickedness in all Ages, look how the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of wicked men were acted in their hatred and malice, you shall find that they go the very same way in this Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration as they did before; and so in one Town, there you shall have one kind of wicked men opposing the Saints, and scorning at them, and so go to another Town and those wicked men there go on in the same road; and so from one Age to another, as wicked men they have the same spirit of wickedness, the same cursed Spirit that doth act them, and therefore they can joyn together, and company together, because they have the same spirit of Satan that doth act in them: Oh! why should not the Saints as well joyn together, and love, and help one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for they have the same precious Grace. Consider what hath been delivered, and the Lord give you Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing in all things.</p>

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:118704:56"/> some time in Heaven before we can take a due Survey of all the Dimensions of this Eternal Fatherly love of God in Christ to his adopted ones, <hi>That we should be called the Sons of God:</hi> that we wretched, base, vile sinners, that we, not Angels, but we should be called, not servants, not friends only, but that we should be called the Sons of God; even we that were the children of the Devil, as Fire-brands of Hell in our selves, that we should not only be pluck'd out of the fire, but be called the Sons of God, not only be Sons, but this should be made known that we should be called the Sons of God; this excellent and blessed state of ours is spiritual, is hidden from the World, the World knoweth us not, and good reason, for it knoweth not him, the World knoweth not our Father, knoweth not Christ, and therefore we cannot marvel that they do not know us, not know the blessed condition we are in, in being the Sons of God, Princes unknown are unrespected: the truth is, we know it but very little our selves, the blessedness of this condition, the happiness of the Saints is a marvelous, secret, and hidden thing; but now we are the Sons of God, we know thus much, that we are so, and yet it doth not appear what we shall be, we are now so, yet though we are now sons, we expect manifestation of greater and more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous things than yet do appear, we have the Foundation of abundance of Glory laid in, but we are sons though we have not our inheritance, yet it doth not appear what we shall be; we now are in afflictions, there is little diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence appears between us and the men of the World, but we know when He shall appear we shall be like him; we are certain there is a time coming that God intends the letting out of himself to the full to his Creatures; we have a little now that sweetens our hearts, and enables us to rejoyce in afflictions and tribulations, but there is a time drawing on, when he shall appear, when our blessed Savior shall come again and appear in Glory, and these eyes of ours shall see him, and when he shall appear, we
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:118704:56"/> shall be made like him, great things we have in Hand, but greater in Hope; much in Possession, but more in Rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion: let this comfort us against the contempts cast up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us by the World, which is blind and bessdes it self in point of Salvation. We are at present, poor and mean, and contemptible and sinful, the off-scouring of all things; but all sin shall be done away, these very bodies of clay that we carry about us, shall be made like unto his glorious body, and our spirits likewise shall have the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of the Father fully resplendant in us, we shall be in such a condition as fit for the appearing of our Husband, of Jesus Christ, fit for enjoyment of communion with him, to stand for ever before him, for we shall be like him, and we shall see him as he is, we do see him now but through a glass, dimly through the Creature, through a Lattice, through his Ordinances, as an old man through Spectacles, as a weak eye looks upon the Sun; but in Heaven we shall see him as he is, so far as a blessed Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is capable of that blessful vision, then we shall see him face to face, we shall see him even as he is; in the mean time while this glory of God shall appear, we have the Grace of Hope put into our hearts, we wait for the time, we expect when this time shall come, and we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce with Joy unspeakable and glorious when this shall be; here is the hope of the Saints that such a time is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming: Now what will this glorious Hope do of such glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious things? the beatifical Vinon of Jesus Christ, and being made like unto him in glory; what will the Hope of this do in the heart? Every man that hath this Hope in him, purifies himself as he is pure. If once the Lord hath raised but such a Hope as this is in the heart of a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, it will do mighty things there, it wil clense the heart, purge it from the filth of sin, will purifie the heart even as Jesus Christ is pure, whom we hope thus to see, and to be made like to; this hope to be made like unto Christ hereafter, doth in some measure make us like unto him for the present; we hope we shall se him, and be like him,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:118704:57"/> for <hi>every man that hath this Hope, doth purifie himself, even as he is pure.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>THIS HOPE:</hi> As if the Apostle should say, there is a base reffuse Hope in the World, that will do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the soul; but he that hath <hi>this Hope,</hi> this choice Hope, as it's said of Faith, that it is the Faith of Gods Elect, so he that hath <hi>this Hope.</hi>

Then let me make Christ to be my pattern now, to be as like him as ever I can for the present: he that hath this hope in him, purifies himself, even as he is pure: that's a true Hope that runs out into Holiness; Faith and Hope purge and work a sutableness in the soul to the things beleeved and hoped for. This is the true Scope of the Words, and the Spiritual meaning of them.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>And the <hi>Pattern: As he is Pure.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Doctrinal Points are,</p>
                     <p>First, <hi>That every man that is a Child of God, is a man of Hopes;</hi> every man that hath this Hope.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>That where this Hope is, it will purge the heart.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>That this Hope causes such a purging as aims at the very purity of Jesus Christ: [He pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifies himself even as Christ himself is Pure.</hi>]</p>
                     <p>The two latter are the chief I confess that the Apostle doth aim at here in speaking of this Hope; yet I shall treat of all three in order, beginning with the first Point, which is intended likewise fully in the words, <hi>Every man that hath this Hope: Every man</hi> that is a Child of God, is a man of Hopes, he is born to great Hopes, and he serves God for the present upon Hopes of what he shall have: God hath in his Service two sorts of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, as men have; Men have Servants, some that they hire by the day, and they have their daies wages after they have done their work, and there's all they can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from their Masters, they are paid for their work: You have other Servants that do serve Great Men and Princes, that have nothing but meat and drink to serve them for a while, they are not hired Servants for so
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:118704:58"/> much a year, but they serve in expectation and hope when such places fall that they shal be preferred to them, they are content to go on, and serve many years, if they may but subsist in the hope of the favor of the Prince, or the Noble-man, to have such Places when they fall. Just thus hath God these two sorts of Servants; there are many people that serve God, that is, do many out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward good things for the present, but all that they have is but as a mans daies labor, they have their wages, their penny, God gives them outward prosperity, and many comforts in this World, and they aim at no higher things from God, but that they may have their Estates, and live in some rank and fashion in the world, they look at such things: Many aim at Credit and Esteem; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is it that they are forward in the Profession of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but for Esteem and Credit, for by ends, and God lets them have it; this is their wages, and al that ever they are like to have from God: But there are others that serve God, and they are willing to spend their strength and all that they have, or are, or can do, for God, and leave it to God to do with them what he will do; others they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent with God that they must have such esteem and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit and estates: Nay, saith a gracious heart, Lord, as for these things, do with me what thou wilt, I'le serve thee as long as I have life and strength, thou shalt have the glory of all; I'le do it upon thy bare word, what thou hast promised for the life that is to come, meerly upon the hope of what glory thou hast revealed in thy Word for thy Saints, that shall be enough to me, though I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver see good day in the world in respect of my outward comforts, though the men of the world should use me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst common sence and reason, and never so vile here, it's no great matter, I do not serve thee for wages here, that which I serve thee for, is in hopes of what is a coming hereafter, and that wages is not a servile thing; you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver find in Scripture an Hypocrite described, that he ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved God out of Hopes of Heaven; we have no such Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:118704:59"/> for an Hypocrite indeed, but he looks for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward here, here's your reward, so an Hypocrite may be described; but that he hath an eye to the recompence of reward that shall be hereafter, it is Grace that doth enable the soul to do this. In the opening of this Point Two things are necessary.</p>
                     <p>First, It will be very useful to open somwhat to you what this Hope is, what is this Hope of the Saints?</p>
                     <p>Secondly, To give you Evidences, that indeed they are men of Hopes, and then briefly to apply it.</p>
                     <p>For the opening, as I did before of <hi>Faith,</hi> so now of <hi>Hope</hi> what it is: I may describe it thus:</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>YE have in this; first the Efficient of this Grace (as others) It is a Grace wrought by the Power of the holy Spirit; and I name it the rather because the Hopes of the most people in the world are the slightest and vainest things that can be, and there is no need of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great power of the holy Spirit to raise such hopes as these are in their hearts; their Hopes are meerly slight kind of opinions that they have, that they know not to the contrary, but it may be God may be merciful to
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:118704:59"/> them; but mark what the Scripture speaks of the Hopes of the Saints in the Epistle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> the 15. chap. and 13. verse, <hi>Now the God of Hope fill you with all Joy and Peace in beleeving, that you may abound in Hope through the power of the Holy Ghost.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>First, God is called the <hi>God of Hope;</hi> noting that it is an excellent Grace, that it gives God a Title, The God of Hope; surely God would not take this Title to him but that it hath a great deal of excellency in it; God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts it his Glory that he doth work such an excellent Grace in the hearts of the Saints, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 13. I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to your consciences, are your Hopes such hopes as hold forth a Glory of God in them? such Hopes that God himself may glory that ever he did raise such Hopes in your hearts: Certainly there's no piece of work that any of you do, that you would hold forth to the world to glory in it, but you would suppose there were some great excellency in that piece of work: If a man should do a piece of work, and hold this forth to all the world, let all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>he world see what I am able to do, and you should have the Title of it; such a man that did such a work, that made such a Ship, as many Ship-wrights that make very useful gallant Vessels, they would be glad to have their names transferred on them, so that they may be known by such a Name; such a man was the Master-Builder of this Ship, that Frigot. So the Hopes in the hearts of the Saints hath such a great deal of excellency in them, that God wil have his name transferred upon them, and called <hi>The God of their Hope.</hi> The truth is, when you speak of Heaven, and Happiness, and Eternal Life, and ask you what you think shall become of you? what? you do hope it shall be well with you: Hope, if it be of the right stamp, the true Grace of Hope that is in the Saints; it is such a Grace that the Lord accounts it his glory that his infinite power was able to raise such a Grace in thy heart; as considering what a desperate condition sin hath brought the Creature into, the infinite distance
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:118704:60"/> that sin had made between God and the Creature, and the gulf that sin plunged the Creature into, I say, it is a great part of the Glory of God that he will glory in to all Eternity, that he could raise up true Hope in the heart of such a sinner to hope for such glorious things as indeed he hath propounded in his Word to the sinner: The God of Hope, and not only so, that God hath his Title from it, but it is here, through the Power of the blessed Spirit, that your Hope may abound through the power of the Holy Spirit; not only that you might have the Holy Spirit work Hope in your hearts, but that the <hi>Power</hi> of the Holy Spirit; there is a great Emphasis in that, as if so be that God had said that the Holy Spirit hath raised Hopes in your hearts, and it could be raised by no other means in the world; that's certain, if it be the Hope by which you shall be saved, that Hope that will not fail you but bring you to Heaven, it is such a Hope that all the Angels in Heaven, and Men in the world were not able to raise in your hearts, only the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit coming into your hearts raised this Hope: Many that have vain and slight spirits, that know little of God and the breach that is between God and them by sin, think it the least thing in the world to hope, what will you not hope in Gods mercies? but that soul that finds the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of sin upon it, finds it the greatest thing in the world to Hope, and it finds that no creature is able to raise Hope in the soul, the Minister comes and speaks excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent things, but alas, he doth not raise Hope, but the holy Spirit must come and put forth his power to raise Hope in the heart of a sinner, that knows his sin, and is made sensible o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <argument>
                        <p>Of the Object of Hope, Is, 1. Some good. 2. Some future good. 3. A supernatural good. 4. The Object of Hope is a difficult good; and therefore compared to an Helmet, and to an Anchor.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THe <hi>Object of Hope,</hi> is all the good, future good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised in the Covenant of Grace, and yet not fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, but hath many difficulties to hinder the fulfilling of it.</p>
                     <p>First, The Object of it is that which is good; for if it be that which is evil, then we fear it, we do not hope for it.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, It's a future good thing; so the Apostle saith in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. if we see a thing we do not hope for it, but that which we do not see, that we hope for: It's a future good thing.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The Object of the Hopes of the Saints is a Supernatural Good: Objects do distinguish Vertues, both Moral vertues and Theological too; here the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is a Supernatural Good, it doth distinguish it from all the Hopes of the World, from those that make the Creature their Hopes; but the Hopes of the Saints is the fulfilling of all the good that is promised in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace that yet is not fulfilled, all mercies that the soul or body stands in need of for this World, and for the World to come: but the special Object of this Hope, is the glorious things that God hath promised in his blessed Covenant to be fulfilled in the world to come; those things that are the most above Sence, and above mans Reason, are the Object of this Hope; that is the appearing of Jesus Christ, and seeing him, and being
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:118704:61"/> made like him, and enjoying eternal communion with him.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, This Object is an Object of Hope that hath a difficulty, for so those that speak of the Nature of Hope they make it to be, not only <hi>Bonum,</hi> and <hi>Futu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> and <hi>Possibile,</hi> a good thing, a future good thing, and possible, but there is another thing, and <hi>that is a difficult thing;</hi> for a man doth not hope for that which will come easily: As for instance, When we go to bed, we do not hope that the Sun will rise in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; or when we put a thing on the fire, we do not hope it will grow hot because it hath no difficulty in it; but when a thing hath a difficulty that many things will hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the accomplishment of it, then we say, we hope; as when you send your Ships to Sea, you hope for a good return, there may be a great many difficulties in the way, but you look beyond those difficulties, and you hope for a good Voyage, so that the Object of Hope is a good that have some kind of difficulty in it: The Saints, they hope for Salvation, and Mercy, and Life, and Glory; but if they look into themselves, they see a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of things that might cross the good that they hope for; when they look upon the abundance of sin that there is in their hearts that makes such a distance between God and them, that is so opposite unto God; when they consider the little service that they do to God, and the great dishonor that God hath from them; when they consider how the Promises are deferred that God hath made, yea, when things seem to work contrary to the Promises that are made, that is the usual way of God, that in his outward Dispensations towards his people, he doth seem to go quite contrary to what he hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed; now this would tempt the soul to despair, and think certainly whatsoever God hath promised, can it be fulfilled, when things go so cross and contrary? so that Reason saith it will not be, Sence saith it cannot be; I but Hope wil then wait, Hope wil break through a great
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:118704:61"/> many difficulties, and yet wait notwithstanding the things are not accomplished; saith Reason and Sence, how is it possible that such a lump of filth and sin should stand before the face of the infinite God with joy, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Jesus Christ shall appear with his holy Angels, and God shall appear in the infinitness of his Holiness and Justice, that such a poor wretch as I am should stand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Jesus Christ, and his holy Angels, and look upon his face with joy, and that this body of mine that hath been such an instrument of sin should be made like the Body of Jesus Christ, and that this poor soul of mine so full of darkness and sinfulness, that it should enjoy eternal communion, with Father, Son, and holy Spirit, how can these things be? Now the Grace of Hope carries through all these difficulties; though I find Gods waies towards me as if he were an Enemy, yea, I pray to him and he doth not hear me, and I am still in the dark, and the terrors of the Almighty stick in my soul, and yet shall I ever come to enjoy his presence, and be partaker of all those glorious things that I have heard that the Saints shall be partakers of in Heaven? These things doth make the Object that the Saints Hope doth work upon, to be a very hard, and a very difficult thing; and here's the use of Hope, that when things appear to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry difficult, yet then Hope, that will wait, and that will hold still; And therefore you find in the Scripture, that <hi>Hope</hi> is compared to two things, To an <hi>Helmet,</hi> and to an <hi>Anchor:</hi> To an Helmet, that you have in <hi>Ephes. 6. The Helmet of Salvation;</hi> that is, the Hope of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that's the meaning; the Helmet of Salvation, that is, the Hope that you have of Salvation, that is to be your Helmet: now what's the use of an Helmet, but to defend the head when we are in the midst of our enemies clashing the Swords about our ears, then to hold up the Helmet, and keep the head? So when a child of God is in the world, and meets with a great deal of oppo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>tion, and much evil that would discourage his heart, that would
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:118704:62"/> strike him at the very head, then he doth hold forth the Hope of Salvation as an Helmet, and that will serve him, that secures his head; it may be his legs, or some other parts may be touched, but that will secure his head, and keep him alive: Thus when we meet with opposition at Land. But there are dangers at Sea as well as by Land; and that you have in <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 19. there Hope is compared to an Anchor, <hi>Which Hope we have as an Anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and which entreth into that which is within the vail:</hi> this is a most elegant si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude for the expression of the Hope of the people of God, by which (those that are Sea-men especially) may learn very much, and especially the holy Spirit speaking by their own Art and Skil; they know what the use of an Anchor is when they are at Sea, if they should not have a good strong Anchor, what would they do? they have not so much need of it in calm weather, they care not so much for a fair painted Anchor; if they cast their Anchor when the winds and tempests come, and the Rocks are hard by them, so that if the Anchor fail them they are split upon the Rocks, or run into the Sands, then Oh how do they esteem of a good Anchor at such a time, &amp; see cause to bless God for the use of it: Thus Christians should expect, for they are Marriners, all Christians are in the World as the Marriners in the Sea; though they have calms somtimes, yet they are to expect tempests and storms that will be ready, so temptations and oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that will be ready to split their souls upon the Rocks, or run them upon the Sands: Now in times of greatest opposition, and of the greatest temptations, there a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian casts his Anchor, the Anchor of his Hope, and there he sticks, there the soul is kept from being hurried up and down, and carried away to split upon the Rock of such a temptation, his Hope that holds him fast, and keeps him safe till the tempests or storms be passed over. We do not know what tempests and storms the Lord hath yet reserved us unto, such, as if there be not this true Hope
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:118704:62"/> in the Text as an Anchor to cast, we are likely to be split upon some rock or other: time may come ere long that the former Grace that hath been opened to you so preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, will appear precious indeed, and so this Grace of Hope will appear to be of some use, as it is in the hearts of most people it lies as a dead thing that is of no use at all; but if times should prove to be yet more perillous as they may be, then it will appear of use: how many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand people are split upon the rocks and sands of the world meerly for want of this true Hope; therfore when they come to suffer any thing in the cause of Christ, they are blown by the temptation to shift in such a sinful way, they have no Anchor at all to hold them, but the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation drives them this way and that way according as they please, when you have your Anchor, and it is cast, your Ship will toss up and down, I but the wind cannot carry▪ it to the sands and rocks, a Christians heart in times of trouble and persecution may stir up and down, and may have some troubles, and fears, and doubts in it, but there is somwhat within, there is this Hope as an Anchor that holds the heart that it shall not be driven up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Rocks, nor upon the sands, it is as an Anchor, and if ever you saw use of an Anchor in your lives, then know there is a great use of this Grace of Hope. And by the way as we go, you may be convinc'd that the Hopes that most men in the world have (and it may be your selves) is but an idle dream, have I known what it was to make use of Hope as an Anchor to my soul, it's impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible but some times or other you must meet with tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pests and storms, strength of temptations: Now if you be acquainted with any temptations in your own hearts, you know what the use of Hope as an Anchor is; it were happy for Christians so soon as ever the temptation comes, to cast Anchor presently, not to be strugling and striving to resist temptations by their own strength, but to cast Anchor: so that Hope is a good, and future good, and hath some kind of difficulty in it; it is that which
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:118704:63"/> keeps the soul from sinking as the Cork in the Net; the Lead, that sinks down the Net, but the Cork, that keeps up the Net: so in the hearts of Christians there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny distempers, and they keep down their hearts, yet they have Hope, and that keeps up their hearts. That's for the Object of it. There's the Efficient of it, and the Object.</p>

                     <p>The quiet waiting of the soul, though things seem to go cross, and are long delayed, yet Hope doth quietly wait till the storm be over, and doth not murmur and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine against God, doth not go out to any shifting waies, but is quiet, notwithstanding things seem to go never so cross: Thus you have it in the 40. <hi>Psalm,</hi> at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, <hi>I waited patiently for the Lord, and he inclined unto me, and heard my cry:</hi> Mark what a condition the Psalmi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:118704:63"/> Lord hath done for him; but yet see what a condition he was in, in the 12. verse: <hi>For innumerable evils have compassed me about, mine iniquities have taken hold up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, so that I am not able to look up, they are more than the hairs of my head, therefore my heart failed me:</hi> My heart was even ready to fail, as I said of the Ship, though it be at the Anchor, yet one that hath not been at Sea before, when it is raised up by the waves, and plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged down again, he would think that it would even sink; and so saith the Psalmist, Mine iniquities have taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to look up, they are more than the hairs of my head, therefore mine heart fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth me. And in the 14 verse, he speaks against the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny enemies that he had at that time that would seek his soul to destroy him, and so he praies against them. And in the 17. verse, <hi>I am poor and needy, yet the Lord thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth upon me; Thou art my help, and my deliverer, make no tarrying O my God:</hi> yet in such a condition as here he was in, he did wait patiently upon the Lord: Hope is that which quiets the heart when things seem to go quite cross and contrary, and it is called <hi>patiently,</hi> Patience is the immediate fruit of Hopes: 1 <hi>Thess. 1. 3. And Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience of Hope;</hi> that's the work of Hope, to be quiet and patient under the hand of God, when any evil doth befal them that seems to cross the things that we hope for; and hence in <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. the text saith, <hi>For ye have need of Patience, that after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the Promise:</hi> Between the doing the will of God, and the fulfilling the Promise; between the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Promise, and the fulfilling, there falls out many things that are cross; you had need of patience, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore saith the holy Spirit, you had need of this Grace to quiet your hearts in the hoping for the Salvation of God, when things are thus cross.</p>
                     <p>And Secondly: There's not only a quieting the heart, but a going out of the heart by expectation, that is, the heart goes out to look for the coming of the Promise that
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:118704:64"/> the Lord hath made: there's a Metaphor in Scripture to express this second Act of Hope; in <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 20. where the Apostle speaks of Hope, <hi>According to my earnest expectation,</hi> the stretching out of the neck, so the word signifies, and so the same word is used of the Creature that doth expect the fulness of the Redemption of the Children of God, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 19. [The stretching out of the Creature] It is a similitude that is taken from a man that expects a friend to come to him which is of great use to him, he stands at his door and puts out his neck, and looks at such a place to see whether he be coming yea or no; as a Malefactor that was ready to die, and expects a pardon to come, he puts out his neck to see his friend when he comes that brings his pardon; <hi>Expectation,</hi> the putting out of the neck to see when the thing will come: So the Saints of God, as they have hopes of glorious things to come, so they do as it were put out their necks to look for those glorious things that God hath revealed in the Word; but when the soul can quietly wait, and look after those things as the only things that he accounts his happiness to consist in. As a Marriners wife that should dwell by the main Sea, when the time comes that her husband should come home, will go neer the Sea shore, and be looking out, because it's a thing that she would fain have, and her mind is upon it, and so she looks out for it: So the truth is, the hopes in the hearts of the Saints above all things is upon the fulfilling of the Promises of the Gospel, and therefore they look out for those things, their thoughts are upon them, and their hearts open for them; Oh when will the Lord come, and when will he fulfil such a Promise: That's the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of the Grace of Hope.</p>

                     <p>And then Secondly, Faith gives an Interest: It's that which belongs to me, and then Hope builds upon Faith; so you have it in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. that we opened in the shewing the excellency of the Grace of Faith, <hi>It's the evidence of things not seen, and the substance of things hoped for;</hi> so that Faith doth give the substantial being to a thing that is hoped for, and Hope hath no bottom at all to rest upon, but what bottom Faith doth give; that's a very considerable thing for the examination of your Hope, You hope that all shall be well with you when you die, but now what is it that is the Foundation of your Hope? how is your Hope raised? is your Hope upon the Sand, or upon a sure Foundation?

Now this coming into the soul doth enlighten it to see the glorious things of the Covenant of Grace, they are the most real things in the world, and they are made over to the soul by this Grace of Faith, they are such things in which my soul hath an interest, such things as I can venture my soul and eternal Estate upon. Faith gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving this Foundation, upon this, hope is raised; well then, saith the soul, notwithstanding I have been such a wretched vile Creature as I have been, yet doth the Lord manifest such a blessed Covenant, and such glorious free Grace in his Word to receive such a guilty vile Creature as I am; Oh what a mercy is this▪ I cannot say but that I am convinced of the freeness of this Grace, and I have felt the Lord drawing my heart to close with it, I cannot say but I have found through Gods mercy some ability to venture my soul and eternal Estate upon that free and rich Grace of his offered in the Covenant: well, is this so, that I find this made good to me by this means? then saith the soul, what though I find not all these things made good to me? yet saith the Devil, what hast thou gotten? thou hast rested upon the free Grace of God in Christ, what hast thou gotten ever since? thou ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

I but then saith the soul here, this bottom I will rest upon, and upon this will I raise my hopes, and I am resolved to wait upon God to my dying day, and to quiet my heart in the Promises that God hath made unto me, and to look after the fulfilling of them, it will come though it be long, I'le wait, and I'le look out for the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of them, and so I am resolved to continue as long as
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:118704:65"/> I remain in the Body. Thus you see that Hope is raised upon a foundation that Faith doth lay, therefore for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny people to talk of their hope to be saved, they hope that when they are sick God will deliver them, whereas indeed that is not the Object of Hope, but a supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral good is the proper Object of Hope, that which is the Object of Eternal Life; what hath given a foundation to your Hope? have you found the mighty Grace of Faith, the work of Gods Spirit upon your souls working Faith, that precious Faith? then your Hopes may have som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to bottom its self upon, but otherwise your Hope is like an Anchor thrown into the water that hath no solid substance to rest upon. So that here you have seen som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what about this Grace of Hope that we do so much speak of; both the <hi>Efficient,</hi> the power of the holy Spirit; the <hi>Object</hi> of it to be the Good, future Good, and the Good of the Covenant of Grace, and the Object Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life, and that with some difficulty; and then you have the <hi>Act,</hi> the quiet waiting, and the going out of the soul in way of expectation; Lastly, you have the <hi>Ground</hi> and <hi>Bottom</hi> of it, <hi>Faith;</hi> first making the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises real, and giving us interest in the Promises; Faith is the Foundation of this Hope; Hope, it is but the Daughter of Faith, if it have not Faith to be the Mother of it, it is not of the right breed, and never will do good to the soul. Now then to give you some <hi>Evidences</hi> that the Saints are men of Hopes: you see what their Hope is, and in the opening of it, somthing you see a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the preciousness of this Grace, and the usefulness of it: That they are men of Hopes, there are many Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations for to manifest this by.</p>

                        <p>Of the Saints being men of Hopes: For, 1. God hath excellent things to communicate, and the Saints are those God hath set apart for the manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting himself unto. 2. God hath promised glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous things to the Saints. 3. The Saints are born to great Hopes. 4. They are called to glorious Hopes.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>FIrst, Certainly the Eternal God that is the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of all Good, that is the infinite treasure of all Excellency, he hath infinite Excellency in himself, and doth delight to communicate those glorious things that are in himself unto his Creatures: the Creatures that God hath to communicate his choice excellencies to, are either Angels, or the Children of Men: Now then, if so be that God hath such things to communicate, and the children of men are the only Creatures in this World that God hath to let▪ out himself to, surely then, those that are the choice of the Children of men, those that are his own▪ Children by adoption they must needs be the Objects that God hath set apart for the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festing himself unto; therefore they must needs be men of Hopes, because God hath so much to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, and there are no other Creatures on Earth that are capable of those glorious things, but only the Saints; therefore▪ there are glorious things for them, however they appear for the present, God hath great thoughts concerning them, to communicate▪ much good to them.</p>

                     <p>Yea Thirdly, They are men that are begotten, born to Hopes, and therefore they are men of great Hopes, because they are of a great Birth, as we use to say of such and such men that are great Heirs; Oh such a one is born to great Hopes, and those are not dead and vain Hopes that are l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

In that place of <hi>Peter</hi> it's very remorkable, where the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle speaking of the happy condition of the Saints, in 1 <hi>Pet. 1. 3. Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy, hath begotten us again unto a lively Hope by the resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Jesus Christ from the dead:</hi> Mark, he hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten us again to a lively Hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead: the Saints have not only good things promised, but they are born to them; and a man makes account that his hopes are sure enough if he be born to great things. All the people of God are so: you that are Beleevers, it may be your Parents left you little or nothing in the World, but know, if you be godly you were born to great Hopes, to be Heirs of a Kingdom, of a Kingdom of Glory, you were born to greater things than if you were born to be the Kings and Queens of the whol World, begotten to a lively Hope, those Hopes that you have in you are not weak things nor fancies, but have a great deal of life in them, and should put life into your souls in the midst of all your sorrows: Yea, they are begotten to a lively Hope;
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:118704:67"/> How? By the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead: You may see what the Spirit of God laies upon the Hopes of the Saints; if your souls have Hope of Life and Salvation that are true Hopes, that are the Hopes of the Saints, how came you by them? you came by your Hopes through the Resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.</p>
                     <p>YOu will say, <hi>How comes the Resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead to be a means to get our Hopes?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>How? The Resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead doth work in this manner, It is the caus of true live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Hope in the hearts of the Saints, namely, by the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Jesus Christ from the dead, God hath decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that he is fully satisfied for the sins of man, and that the work of Redemption is fully wrought out, otherwise Christ must have been held in the Prison of the Grave for ever; but now when Jesus Christ is let out of the prison of the grave, and the bonds of death taken from him, this doth declare to Men and Angels that the work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption is perfect, it doth hold out this to the soul upon which Faith is grounded, and Hope is raised; so there's an efficacie in this to work Hope in the soul, nay then saith the poor wretched sinners that apprehended such an infinite gulf between God and it, and saw it self through the guilt of sin sunk down into such a bottomless gulf of misery. If God the Father shall testifie to all the world by the Resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead that he is satisfied, and that all the work is finished, why may not such a sinful wretch as I am have hope of Salvation and Eternal Life through him, and indeed the consideration of this helps the soul against that temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of presumption, for so the Devil will come when as a sinner begins to have Hope, yet I hope for all this that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven this vile body of mine, may come to be hereafter like the body of Jesus Christ, glorious, and that I shall enjoy
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:118704:67"/> eternal communion with Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, when thou seest the Devil come and say, what a presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous wretch art thou? darest thou presume that ever thou shouldst see the face of God at the great day with comfort, that thou should'st be raised up to have everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting communion with God, and Christ, and the Saints? what high presumption is this? No, saith the sinner, I am content to own what thou canst charge me with in vileness and baseness, I am as vile and wretched as thou canst make me, I but yet it is not presumption for me to Hope; Why? Because that which I make the ground &amp; bottom of my hope is not in my self, but I have revealed in the Doctrine of the Resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ from the dead, the Lord Jesus Christ hath come and taken my Nature upon himself, and being in the form of a servant hath had the sins of the people of God laid to his charge, and hath stood before the Father clad with their sins, and he hath satisfied the Justice of God the Father, and wrought out a perfect work of Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation and Redemption, and I hear that the Father hath discharged him, and he is raised now to the Heavens, and sits at the right hand of God the Father, and there makes intercession for sinners, and upon this it is that I ground my Hope., I am begotten to a lively Hope through this that Jesus Christ hath done, and therefore though I be never so poor, and vile, and sinful, yet I have enough to raise a lively Hope, that I shall one day attain to such things that are writtnn in the Book of God. Indeed the things that are written in the Book of God, they appear to me somtimes as if they were too good to be true, what is it possible that ever such a wretch as I should attain to such great and glorious things? were they not so great and glorious, I could hope for them: but now if thou understandest aright the Doctrine of Grace, and this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, it's not the greatness of the thing that any way should discourage thy Hopes, for thou hast enough to raise thy Hopes for the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:118704:68"/> enjoyment of the greatest things that God is able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, or thy soul to receive; that's certain, thou hast encouragement to hope for these, let the distance between them and thee be never so great, yet Jesus Christ being between the Father and thee, he makes up all the distance; and therefore by the Resurrection of Christ from the dead, we are begotten to a lively Hope, they are men of Hopes then certainly that are born to Hope, and that through the Resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.</p>
                     <p>And Fourthly, <hi>They are called to Hopes;</hi> that you have in <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. the Apostle there praies very earnestly for the Ephesians that they might understand this, in the 18. verse, <hi>Oh that the eyes of your understanding may be opened, that ye may know what is the Hope of his Calling:</hi> you are people that are called to glorious Hopes, but you understand them but little; Oh saith the Apostle, that the eyes of your understanding might be but opened, to know what is the Hope of his Calling, and what the Riches of the Glory of his Inheritance in the Saints; Oh this were a good prayer to pray for many poor distressed souls: Oh they would live as men and women above the world, if the eyes of their understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding were but opened, that they might know what is the Hope of his Calling, and what the Riches of the Glory of his Inheritance in the Saints.</p>
                     <p>And besides that, there's a further evidence that the Saints certainly are men of Hopes, because they do so constantly follow after God in the midst of all discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements, they can endure so much persecution, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce so much in tribulations, and nothing can take off their hearts from God, had they not Hopes, certainly it were impossible that they should go on in that evennes in following after God, that they should endure so much persecution here in this world, it's an evidence that they are men of Hopes because they receive so little from God in this world; you know the Apostles Argument, <hi>If we
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:118704:68"/> had Hope only in this world, we were the most miserable of all men:</hi> Do you not see how the Saints of God are persecuted and contemned? That thing that the Devil would labor to beat down our Hopes withal, is the very thing that the Apostle labors to help to raise our Hopes upon. The Devil saith, if you be sons and daughters to God, why doth God let the Devil and ungodly men pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail over you? Now the Saints turn the reason quite up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Devil, And doth God suffer the Devil and wicked men to prevail upon us now, surely then God hath reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Great things for us hereafter: the Devil saith, sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God doth not regard you, and it's but a fancy for you to hope seeing God leaves you so here; nay, saith a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever, because God suffers me to be afflicted so here, therefore there is glorious things a coming; if we had Hope in this life only, of all men we were most misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: And so divers other Evidences might be to prove that the Saints are men of Hopes; a word or two now for Application.</p>

I remember a learned man doth allegorize thus upon it, <hi>God gives us the Moon of Hope to guide us in the night of affliction:</hi> We know Moon-light is

And let all the Saints of God be look'd upon as happy Creatures, thou seest them mean in the world, and poor; I but know, they are men of Hopes: you look upon Princes that are great Heirs with honorable respect; look so upon every child of God as one that hath a precious soul, that hath great Hopes to come hereafter; you hope in men, but they fail, and you hope in the Creatures, and they fail; yet h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

THE Second Doctrine is, <hi>That every man that hath this Hope, purifies himself.</hi> The word (as I have already noted) is not <hi>Sanctifies himself,</hi> but <hi>Purifies himself;</hi> for Christ is said to San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie himself that hath no sin: but <hi>Purifying</hi> doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply want of Holiness, and that there is uncleanness and filthiness.</p>
                     <p>In this Second Point, there are these Four Particulars.</p>
                     <p>First, <hi>That sin is a pollution and defilement.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>The Saints of God, the best of them in this World, that have the best Hopes, they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders of sin, they have uncleannesses.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>They do clense themselves.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>That the Hope which they have is that which causes them to clense themselves.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He that hath this Hope, purifies himself: sin then is uncleanness, it is filthiness. In <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. saith Christ himself at verse 20. <hi>These are the things that defile a man;</hi> that is, that which proceeds out of the heart, the evils that flow from that unclean Fountain; these are the things that defile a man: Sin is called uncleanness and filthiness in the very abstract; and it is compared in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to all kind of filthiness, to <hi>Vomit, Mire, Menstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Cloathes, Sores, Wounds that have filthy matter in them,</hi> and many such things. Now the impurity of sin consists,</p>
                     <p>First, In the contrariety that it hath to the Holiness of
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:118704:70"/> God, it is the only thing that is contrary to Gods infinite Holiness, and to his pure Nature.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, It is the corruption and rottenness of a mans soul.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Sin is the mixture of the soul with that which is more base and vile than the soul, and that doth defile the soul: as your cloathes, when they have dirt upon them, there is somwhat upon them worse than the cloaths which doth defile them; but if there were Gold or Silver Lace, that doth not defile, men think not that that defiles the cloath, because that's better than the cloath: so in Mettal, it's no defiling of Silver if it be mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Gold, but it is, if it be mixed with Lead: So the mixture of the soul with God, with Heavenly things, doth not defile, but makes the soul more pure, more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent; but the mixture of the soul with sinful waies, with lusts, and with the Creature, for the soul mixes its self with that which is worse than its self: thus the soul comes to be defiled as the silver is defiled with lead, and the Saints they see sin as the greatest defilement of any thing in the world, because they see into the infinite pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Gods Nature, and into the purity of the Law, and into the excellency of their own souls, and therefore they see sin to be filthy, it is such a filthiness as makes the Creature loathsom in the eyes of God, for the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is not loathsom in Gods eyes by any bodily defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; one that rakes in channels, or that sweeps chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, such a one is not loathsom in Gods eyes, he may be more glorious in Gods eyes, if he be godly, than the Prince upon his Throne if he be wicked; though out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward defilements makes us loathsom in the eyes of one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, yet not in the eyes of God; but sin is such an uncleanness that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Containing four Answers to such as live in a course of sin, and put it off with this excuse, The best have their sins in them.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THe first is this, Thou tellest me that the best of all hath some sin, therefore thou hopest that all is well with thee: I tell thee as well that the worst of all may have some good in them, as the Saints have had some ill in them, therefore thou hopest that notwithstanding thy evil, thou mayest go to Heaven; then I tell thee that some Reprobates have had more good in them than thou
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:118704:73"/> hast; notwithstanding thy good thou maiest go to Hell. Thou tellest me of <hi>Lat,</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>David</hi> that had fin, and yet they went to Heaven: then I'le tell thee of <hi>Saul,</hi> and <hi>Ahab,</hi> and <hi>Judas,</hi> and <hi>Herod,</hi> and if it come to be examined it may be they had more good in them than thou hast, and yet they perished; when did'st thou as <hi>Ahab</hi> did? when the Prophet threatned him in the Name of God the text saith he humbled himself in sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloath, and went softly: <hi>Herod</hi> heard <hi>John</hi> the Baptist gladly, and reformed many things, Oh he loved to hear <hi>John,</hi> and he reverenced <hi>John;</hi> hast thou done so? <hi>Judas</hi> was troubled for his sin, and came and made resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of that which he had wrongfully gotten; hast thou done so? Never tell me of some sin in the Saints for to be thy comfort, rather do thou look upon the good that was in the wicked and Reprobate, and see whether that be not more for thy discouragement.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Thou tellest me that the Saints have sin re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in them as well as you; but what if your sin should prove a sin unto death? there's a great deal of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in sin, Suppose a woman should have her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band lie dead and stiff, and no breath at all, one should come and say to her, why are you troubled? many men are stiff with cold, and hold their breath a great while; Oh but saith she, it's death, the stiffness is the stiffness of death, and his breath is quite gone; she will not be put off with that, that some are stiff with cold, and some hold in their breaths. So thou speakest of the sins that thou hast, and the Saints have sin; but thy sin may be that sin that proceeds from death, and not from infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and weakness; as in that place of <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. chapter, about the 50. verse, <hi>They have corrupted themselves, their spot is not the spot of his children:</hi> Thou hast spots and defilements in thee, that are not the spots of Gods children: but now to shew the difference between the spots of wicked men and the spots of the Saints, that would require a large Treatise: but I'le mention this
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:118704:74"/> now to take off men that they may not presume and think themselves safe with this plea, because the best of all have some sin; but let them check themselves with this; let me take heed that I go not away with this too far, let me examine, Is my spot the spot of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren? it may be my sin is of another Nature, my sin may prove to be the sin to death, and theirs may be but an infirmity.</p>
                     <p>The third thing that I would speak to these, is this; Those that are godly and have true grace, they have some sin remaining in them; yet I never found in Scripture, nor I think there cannot be any example found in any that had such a sin in them to plead for their sin, and to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den themselves in their sin, because that others of the Saints had sin as well as they; you shall not find this in Scripture, you shall not find this among the Saints; though they have some sin in them, yet not this sin to plead for their sin, and harden themselves in their sin up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that consideration, because other of the Saints have sin as well as they; Oh no, they rather are the more afraid and troubled for their sin: If thou had'st an ingenious spirit in thee, thou would'st rather reason thus, Oh Lord is it so, that thou art not only dishonored by the men of the world that know thee not, but the best of thy people carry about with them a body of death, and shall I ad to the sin that is committed in the world? thou hast disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor enough, and it's that which I should take to heart that thou art dishonored by any, especially by thy own children, and shall that which should be the matter of my grief and mourning, be the hardening of me in my sins? Oh how contrary is this to the ingenuity of a Christian.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, I might mention this one thing more, The Saints have their sins, but how are they affected with them? <hi>Paul</hi> had his sin, but how was he affected? <hi>Oh wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from this body of death?</hi> You never find him crying out of himself, that he was a wretched man because he was hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:118704:74"/> and naked, and suffered persecution, but his sin did make him so; is it so with thee? doth the remainer of thy sin make thee skreek out to God, and account thy self in the most wretched condition because of thy sin; how art thou perplexed and troubled for the loss of thy estate, and of any evil that doth befal thee; if the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies should come and plunder thee of all that thou hast, then thou would'st skreek out; but now thou canst a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree well enough with thy sin, and think it's no other but that which the Saints have: Will people be satisfied with this when they are plundred of all their estates and abused, I am plundred no more than others are? And the truth is, we ought to comfort our selves in this, that indeed though we suffer, yet we suffer not so much as others of the Saints of God have suffered in former times; we may reason so in our sufferings, but not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son thus by our sin, but we should rather account our sins the worse, because God is dishonored by others as well as by us. But we need say no more of this, the next Point will help us in this and that's the third thing.</p>

                     <p>Object. <hi>Can a man purifie himself? Is it not God that must clense and sanctifie us? In</hi> Isaiah, 1. <hi>about verse</hi> 25.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> For the Answer to that, we are to know that the Acts of God upon the hearts of his Saints are in such a manner, as though they be Gods Acts, yet God is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to have them be acted as the actions of his people; so gracious is God to his people, as those things that he is fain to help them to do, he will have them accounted their actions: In that known place in <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. the latter end of the 12, and 13. verses, <hi>Work out your salvation with fear and trembling</hi> (for saith he) <hi>it is God that worketh in you both to will and to do of his good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure:</hi> Do you work, for it is God that worketh in you; though God do work in you, yet it's you that work too; the Saints are said to work: and this may be noted as very profitable and useful to us, to take away that lazy kind of reasoning that is in many people, they sit still and do nothing, and they can do nothing without God, what can they do, it's God that must do all? can they get power over their sins, it must be God that must do it? and so upon that they sit still and do nothing: Mark
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:118704:75"/> here, my text saith that he purgeth himself, Oh do not stand reasoning, God calls thee to do it as if thou wert to do it alone thy self, he doth purifie himself; and if thou belongest to God, God doth put a principle into thee that thou art able to do it: Not without God: that's true, you cannot put a bit of meat into your mouthes without God: Now though it's God that doth all, yet God doth put a Principle into the new Creature, that the new Creature is able to stir and live sutable to the Nature of a new Creature: what's the difference between a live thing, and a dead thing? a dead thing is that which hath no moving in its self at all (but to its Center) as the Earth and the Water only move to their Center, but let a heavy thing lie upon the Earth, and it stirs not, you may take your hand and stir it up and down, but it hath no principle within its self to move: That's the difference between life and no life, one hath a spirit in its self to move, and the other hath not: So where there is no life of Grace, there such a one by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal things may be put upon this thing or that; but one that hath life, hath received a principle in its self to move: Your Jacks, and Clocks, and such kind of things that move by weight, have no principle within, but only the weights that hang down without that moves them: but now your Watches, they have a Spring within to move them. So the Saints, they have a Principle in them, that they are able to purifie themselves; it's true, God at first comes upon them, and they are meerly passive; at first God comes and shews to them the evil of their sin, and holds over them the wrath that is due for their sins, and causes sin to be bitter and terrible to them, shews it in the dreadful visage of it; Look here's your sin that you take such del<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ee what it brings you to, and so God doth by degrees make men weary of their sin; but that doth not do the work: Afterwards the Lord comes by his Almighty Power, and doth dead that bitter root that was in the soul, mortifies it, and so puts a
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:118704:76"/> Principle of Grace into the soul that now it's able to live to himself; at first we are meerly passive, but when God hath done that first work of his, then he puts a principle into us to act; It's true, we have need of continual supply, but observe, all the assistance that the Saints have from God to help them against their sin, it's not to put new principles into them, it's but to stir up those principles that God puts into them at their first conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; as soon as ever God doth convert any soul, he puts a Principle of Grace contrary to every sin in them, there is no sin that the soul is inclinable to, but at the very first moment of conversion there is a principle of Grace put into the soul contrary to every sin, and therefore he doth purifie himself upon these three Considerations.</p>
                     <p>First, Because it's a Principle contrary to sin, and one contrary will seek to get out another: in wicked and ungodly men, sin is with them as their Nature, as poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is in a Toad; but the Saints though they have sin in them, yet it is in them as their sickness, and they have a contrary Nature besides their sinful Nature, they have a sinful nature, but they are partakers of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and that doth oppose the sinful Nature as fire doth water▪ the Saints having that Principle contrary to sin as fire to water, it's impo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>sible but that Principle with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in them, must be consuming their sin, and so purifying them.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, As it is contrary to sin, so it is an active Principle, or Grace, for it's the Divine Nature, and the Divine Nature is a pure Act; God is a pure Act, and the Divine Nature that we have doth partake much of God, there's the Image of God, and so it comes neer, and it's very like God, therefore must needs be very active and stirring; and things that are active, stirring, and clen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, as water i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Now the wicked and ungodly, when they have sin in them, it comes into them as filthy water, and there it putrifies: but now the Saints sin is as a running water, the principle that they have is stirring in them, and so comes to be clen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing; and indeed the more active Christians are, the more clean. Christians, if you would be clean, let Grace be active, if Grace be stirring and active, you will be clean; as a man that is most active and stirring, usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hath the most clean body, and people that stir but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, diseases grow upon them: Grace makes the Saints so active and stirring, and so by that means they purifie themselves.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The Principle is a powerful Principle, it's contrary and active, and very strong in them, for it's the Divine Nature, and that must needs be very powerful. If a man hath poyson in his body, yet if he hath a strong heart, he may work out his poyson; as if a man hath had some poyson, and hath escaped, we say, if such a one had not had a very strong heart, certainly he would have been a dead man; some that have the sickness, yet having strong Natures, do work out the venom that was within them: So the Saints, though they be weak (that is in comparison with others) and have not so much strength as others of the Saints have, yet take them considered in themselves, there is not the weakest Saint but hath the Divine Nature in them, and therefore hath that in them that is stronger than corruptions, and it will work out corruptions in time; it is the Divine Nature, there<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>What work the Saints and Sons of God do when they purifie themselves. <hi>First,</hi> A gracious heart is willing, and takes pains to know the worst of its self. <hi>Secondly,</hi> A gracious heart, 1 Joyns and sides with every Truth: 2 It will seek to maintain every Truth: 3 It will apply the Truth: 4 It submits to the Truth: 5 It will hold the Truth on the heart when the heart would be weary of it. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> A gracious heart, sets on work all the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility it hath for the opposing of sin. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> A gracious heart takes up every duty God requires.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>BUt now the main thing in this Point about purifying themselves is this, To shew what work the Saints do when they purifie themselves: Those that are the Sons of God, and have this Hope, do purifie themselves: What is the work of a gracious heart when it is purifying of its self?</p>
                     <p>First, Such a heart is truly willing, yea, and takes pains to know the worst of it self, and to find out all the secret corners where any filth of heart may possibly lie: that's the first work of a Saint when he goes about to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie himself; he doth not lie down sullenly and heavily, and say, Lord I can do nothing, it must be thy work to sanctifie me; no, but he doth stir up, and is doing, and falls about the work, he finds that he hath abundance of sin and uncleanness; the first thing that he doth, he falls to searching, Oh that I could come to find out where all
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:118704:77"/> the poyson of sin doth lie, there are many windings and turnings in my heart, and a great deal of filth lies there; as in a mans garments, ther's not only filth and dirt got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, but if you should rip the garment, and look into e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very seam and fold, there you would see the dust gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: And so it is in the heart, one that is a gracious heart will purifie himself, he doth not only take notice of sins that are plain in view, that every one can see as well as himself, but he will get into his own heart and be sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and examining every faculty of soul, what sin there is in my mind, and what mistakes of God, and the waies of God; are not some mistakes in my mind the cause of some evil that is in my heart and life, and what there is in my conscience, and in my thoughts; Oh the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of evil that there is there, there quickly he will find a sink of sin in the life. Sin in the affections, how they are carried upon wrong objects, and taken off from the right object, and if upon the right, yet they are fickle and unconstant in that way; and sin in the members of the body, the very eyes, and ears, and hands, and fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t; the soul I say will be searching and trying what filth it can find in every secret corner; it takes pains, and makes it to be the work to find out all, and he is not troubled if any body will come and tell him that they are afraid that if he will examine his heart in such and such a thing, that he shall find a great deal of filth that he knew not of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: now one that is gracious, will be glad that he may be any way helped to find out any filthiness that before he did not see in himself; would any body be offended with one that should come and tell you that there is a spot in your face? he would thank you if you would tell him of that; so a gracious heart would thank any that shal help him to find out his corruptions.</p>
                     <p>The Second thing that a gracious heart doth in purify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its self is this, It doth joyn and side with every Truth of God, by which it doth come to be sanctified: every Truth though it be never so hard a truth unto it, and
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:118704:78"/> seems to be never so terrible, yet blesses God for every Truth, is glad of it, he is glad it is a Truth, and that it pleases God to reveal such a Truth unto him; before I knew this, there was a great deal of evil that lay in my heart, and it was like to lie longer, but I hope this Truth will help me against many corruptions in my heart, that I understood not before.</p>
                     <p>And in his joyning side with every Truth, he is not only glad of it, but will seek to maintain every Truth of God that makes against his corruptions: Many men and women when they come to some conviction of some Truth that works against some of their corruptions, if they should come into any company, and hear any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy object against it, they are secretly glad that they have an Objection against it: but now a gracious heart when it hath gotten a Truth that doth tend much to the sanctification of it for the purging out of corruptions it will maintain the truth against Objections.</p>
                     <p>In the third place, It will apply the Truth, it will lay it to the sore; it will not keep it only in the understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, soaring aloft, but applies it, and laies it home to the heart, Oh my soul, take thou notice of this Truth, it concerns thee neerly, and so laies it upon the sore where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it knows it self to be most guilty.</p>
                     <p>And then fourthly, It submits to the Truth, it's the Truth of God, and though it will pluck away such a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption wherein I have had so much content, yet it is the Truth of God, and I will submit to it.</p>
                     <p>Yea Fiftly and lastly, It will continue and hold the Truth upon the heart, when the heart would be weary of a Truth, somtimes you will find it, if you observe but your own hearts, in applying some Truths, your hearts through the corruption of them will be weary of some fearching Truth, and will be ready to cast it off; but then a gracious heart holds it up, and will have the Truth continue upon his heart, for the corruption is not eaten out. A Child that hath a plaister upon a sore, if it
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:118704:78"/> smart a little will be ready to pluck it off; but let it stay on til<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 span">
                           <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                        </gap> is well, and then it will fall off on its own accord: So a heart that doth desire to purifie its self, keeps on the Truths of God though they be painful to the corrupt man, yet it keeps them on to draw away the corruption that is in the soul: And that's the second work of one that doth purifie himself; that is, Joyns side with every Truth of God that makes against his corruptions.</p>
                     <p>The Third thing is this, A gracious heart, it sets on work all the ability that it hath for the opposing of sin in the soul, will let none lie idle; if God hath given unto it any parts of Nature, Memory, Natural Understanding, Natural Judgment, it even stirs up al them; and if there be any common gifts of Gods <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>pirit, it stirs them up all to get out the sin that is in the soul; it doth not hold it a light matter, as most people do, We are all sinners, and God be merciful to us, &amp; I would we could do better, and such kind of words, and so makes sin as a light thing; and he hopes he shall do so no more; but what dost thou do to get out thy sin? dost thou stir up all that is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thee? all thy parts and common gifts, and all thy gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and set them all on work that thou mayest purge and clense thy heart from thy sin? and all is little enough, for sin doth so twist its self into the hearts of the children of men, and leaven them, that it's all little enough to get out the corruptions from the soul: Indeed there's no such need of such a stir to keep the soul from the acts of gross sins in the world; that may be done without such a do: but if thou wilt come to purifie thy self as Christ is pure, there needs all this ado, and a gracious heart finds the need of all this; and that heart that doth not find the need of this, it hath cause to suspect its self that it doth not understand the way of God in the hearts of the Saints.</p>
                     <p>The Fourth thing that the heart doth in the purifying of its self, is, To take up every duty that God requires,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:118704:79"/> and delight in all means and helps that God doth afford unto him, and make use of them all this way<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> to clense it from its sin, to take up all duties; do not think that because Christ must work all, therefore what need we perform any duties, and account them duty-mongers that shall make conscience of duties; but it may be those that do slight them so, they have not found the benefit of them themselves, and therefore they think that others should not make such conscience of them, as appears in the loosness of their carriage; observe the waies and the lives of those that do slight duties so much, how quickly unclean they grow; there is not that graciousness in them converse as formerly: But now the Saints do find that in duty performed in a holy way, that by them they draw nigh to God, and have communion with God, and so find that God conveys himself through those to them, clensing of the heart.</p>
                     <p>You will say, <hi>Can Duties clense the heart?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They are the Pipes and Conduits through which God is pleased to convey himself, and grace and power for the clensing of the heart; God conveys his Water through these Pipes for the clensing of the heart, &amp; therfore a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious heart will set upon every duty; if it hath tryed one and cannot find power by that, it fals to another, &amp; every Ordinance, and ordinary &amp; extraordinary Duties; as you know there's some things so foul that ordinary things wil not serve to clense them, you have the washing of things, and you have the scowring of them; some things you may wash, but all the water in the world will not make them clean, but they must be scowred: So there's a clensing of the heart by ordinary duties, and by extraordinary du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: and make this to be the a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>m and end of the heart in the use of means to clense sin, Wherefore do I come to the Word? Oh that the Word might meet with my sin, and that God would bless the Word for to convey som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to my soul to clense it, to purifie my heart; it comes to the Word for that very end that it might get sin clen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed;
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:118704:79"/> when it comes to the Sacrament, it is to that very end; Oh I have such and such corruptions that prevail against me, and I cannot get power over them, and now I come to this other Ordinance to see what the blood of Jesus Christ will do for the clensing of my soul; and the soul before it comes to such an Ordinance propounds this end to its self. I appeal to your consciences when you go to prayer, can you say that this is one great end that you go to prayer, Oh that by his Ordinance of God I might get some power against such <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>

                        </gap>, over my corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? and so when I go to the Word, I go for this very end: Now as you propound this to your selves, so if you indeed follow this work of purifying your hearts as you ought, when you are at the Duty, you do observe there the way of God towards you, whether God doth come in to you, according to what you do desire, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you do feel God taking off your hearts from your sin, and letting in somthing of his spirit into your souls to strengthen you against it, and then after you have done, you look back to see what you have got; suppose you pray against passion, what have you got by it? are you more humbled? and then thou should'st be troubled in thy heart because God doth absent himself from thee, and not grant unto thee that which thou aimest at. Thus a Christian doth purifie himself, and will not have sin to lie quiet in his heart, he hath a working heart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his sin.</p>

                        <p>Of the five last things a gracious heart doth in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying its self from sin. <hi>Fiftly,</hi> It's willing to endure any difficulty that it may get power against sin. <hi>Sixthly,</hi> It especially labors against its chief and master sin. <hi>Seventhly,</hi> He acts his Faith upon the blood of Jesus Christ. <hi>Eightly,</hi> He is restless till somthing be done. <hi>Ninthly,</hi> In all this contention of the heart about sin it doth get some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>A Fift thing that a gracious heart doth in purifying its self, is this, It's willing to endure any difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty so be it that it may get any power against his sin, he is willing to suffer any thing as well as to do: If God will be pleased that the performance of Holy Duties shal not do it, and Ordinances shall not do it; if the Lord will be pleased to take that course, to lay his hand of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions upon them, to bring the fiery tryal, yet if that may be but to purge me, as in <hi>Isa. 27. This is all the fruit thereof to purge away their sin,</hi> speaking of great afflictions that should be upon the Church; Oh let once a gracious heart find this, and how willing is such a one to be afflicted? Yea, the main thing that doth quiet the hearts of the Saints in their afflictions is this, Oh, I hope that the Lord intends no other but this fruit to purge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way my sin, and if this be Gods intention let him do with me what he will; we know fire doth purge away dross from Mettal when other things cannot do it; and God sees that I have a vile wretched heart, and I must have afflictions to purge away my sin: The will of the Lord be done, and I account all my losses made up, if the loss of the deerest thing I have in the World may but
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:118704:80"/> help me with power against such a corruption.</p>
                     <p>Indeed this is the way that the Saints have to make up what they have lost in the Creature; God plucks a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way a child, or any thing that is dear, a carnal heart thinks it's impossible to have such a loss made up, Oh but if God will but sanctifie this affliction to take away my sin, I shall account it as great a good as I had before. So do I suffer pain, and am troubled, and have greater affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions than others; if God by this takes away my sin, I am willing to suffer any thing: as you know, you that have some stains in your linnen cloathes, so that they look yellow, you are willing in frosty nights to lay them abroad, and the frosty nights that they are abroad in, that makes them look white: and so it may be with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of your souls, you have so defiled your souls with sin, that it's not a little dirt, that may be soon wip'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, that is upon you, but the filth of sin hath stained your hearts, and the Lord he laies you out a frosting that he might clense you; and so when you have such a principle as you are willing to endure any thing in the world for your clensing; this is a purifying your selves. And then not only afflictions from Gods hands, but from mens hands too; if God should use wicked men to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict thee never so much, they are but as Gods wisps, and it may be to scowr his people withal, and so to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way their sin, still they are base and vile, and as soon as God hath done with them to scowr his people, he will throw the wisp upon the dunghil.</p>
                     <p>The Sixt thing that he doth in purifying himself is this, He doth labor as against all sins, yet especially against his chief and Master sin, the sin of his complexion and constitution, against that which he finds the most suta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his corrupt Nature, that it is that he labors to clense himself of more than any: there's many people will la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor to clense themselves from gross sins that they shall be disgraced by, that every body takes notice of to their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honor, but there is some one special bosom sin it may be
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:118704:81"/> that they think they could not part withal; now one that hath this Hope that sees one sin more than another suitable to Nature, he doth lay the chief strength that he hath against that sin, against this darling sin, knowing that if he can but purge out that, the other noisom hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors will follow upon that; as there may be some ill humor in the body, if that may be but purged out, other humors that are attendant upon that, they will be soon purged out; but many that go to work like unskilful Physitians, they go to purge out the humor that is the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the disease, but they purge not out the humor that is the cause of the disease: So unskilful Christians, they look at humors, at sins that are the effect of such a corruption, but they never look at the sin that is the cause of that corruption.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, In the next place, Such a one doth puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie himself, not only by doing thus, but he must be sure if he do it in a Christian way that there must be this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, or else all these will be but Legal, except he doth together with these, <hi>endeavor to act his Faith upon the Blood of Jesus Christ, and look upon the application of the Blood of Jesus Christ to his soul, as that which doth put an efficacy and life to all the other.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>You will say, <hi>Can a man apply the blood of Jesus Christ to his soul before he hath purified himself? he must first purifie himself, and then apply it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Not so: A man may lawfully without any presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, apply the blood of Jesus Christ to his soul though he be never so vile, if he doth apply it to that end, as well to take away the filth of sin, as the guilt of sin, if thou canst but apply it so; and this a true Christian doth, not only because the blood of Christ wil make peace between God and him, and that the blood of Christ hath in it a vertue to clense from sin, but likewise because it's the blood of Christ that gives an efficacy to all other means, and all other Ordinances, and so he goes about to purifie himself. What's the reason that many of you that have
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:118704:81"/> sought to clense your selves, have been troubled for your sins? you have been upon your sick beds, and there you have cryed out bitterly for your sins, and there you have resolved against them, and you have spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from your hearts then, yet nothing hath come upon it; but you rest in your own endeavors, and look not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the blood of Christ as that which must give efficacy to all your endeavors and resolutions, you must do that: He that hath this Hope doth purifie himself.</p>
                     <p>Eightly, The next is this: That in all this, such a soul is restless till somthing be done, and he will never be at quiet till somthing be done, he hath made use of these means, Well, I have done this a long time saith one, and I find nothing come of it, but he will never lis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen to such a temptation, but goes on continually wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and resolves he will not neglect any thing. Oh, but it may be I shall carry the corruption to my grave, the striving of my heart against it to my grave: that's the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution of a gracious heart, though the body is weary and the flesh, yet it goes on pursuing this enemy of it, and nothing can give rest to it; it's not what I have in the world, and what comforts I have in my family; nothing can give rest to the heart, but the clensing it from sin. I have b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>n abroad in company, and defiled my self by such a sin, and made my self the more unfit for communion with God, and therefore nothing that I have can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent my soul till I have gotten my soul in some measure clensed: Now when the ground of your ease and quiet is from your purifying, that's ease and quiet indeed.</p>
                     <p>Ninthly and lastly, In all this contention of the heart about sin, it doth get somthing: You will lay, I have labored and gotten nothing; do not wrong the Grace of God, let these things be done, and certainly the soul will get way against sin; it may be not just in that particular, but in somthing or other, either one grace or other active and stirring: A Physitian may clense the body of a great many filthy humors, and yet the Patient not feel it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:118704:82"/> but he may feel his body in a worse condition than he was before he was medled withal; he comes to the Physitian, and saith, Oh Sir, that which you gave me hath done me more hurt than good: Why? how did it work, saith he? It wrought thus and thus: Oh do not trouble your self, for do you think that I can ger away al these ill humors at once? before, all the ill humors lay still, and so it did not pain you, and was more dangerous then; but now some comes to be taken away, and all the other is stirred, and so that's the reason that you find your selves worse than you were before: So it is with the soul that is thus seeking to purifie its self, Perhaps while it is laboring, such a one saith I never found my self worse in all my life, never more wandering, more deadness, more corruptions stirring; the truth is, this is but the stirrings of the humor, and there is a great deal of Hope that there is somthing purged away, for so the text saith, he that hath this Hope, doth not desire only to purifie himself, and wish, and pray that he might purifie himself, but he doth purifie himself; there is an actual purifying, for certainly God will not be wanting to a heart that goes upon this work in this way: And thus you have had the working of the heart in purifying of its self.</p>
                     <p>But yet the chief thing is behind, That he doth it by this Hope of his; whereas others, the main thing that hardens them in their sin, it is their Hopes, they hope that they shall be saved when they die, and that God loves them, and therefore they are secure in their evil and sinful way: the Hopes of the wicked is the very thing that doth make them more secure in their evil waies, and the Hopes of Gods mercies that the Saints have, that's the thing whereby they come to purge out corruption; yea, to purifie themselves as Jesus Christ is pure.</p>

                        <p>The Hope of the Saints makes them purifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. <hi>First,</hi> Because the Hope of the Saints is of such high, great, wonderful, glorious things: Their Hopes, 1 Are great, and therefore doth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levate their hearts: 2 Their Hopes being great and high makes them jealous of any thing may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict their Hopes: 3 The greatness of their Hopes, fills their hearts with comfort, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore purifies: 4 The greatness of their Hope purges their hearts because it inflames their spirits with Love to God.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THat which remains, is, <hi>That this Hope of his doth make him purifie himself.</hi> That which I intend now, is to open how this Hope doth cause him to purifie himself, together with the Application of it, [<hi>He that hath this Hope purifies himself.</hi>]</p>
                     <p>The Hopes of the Saints are the things that makes them to purifie themselves.</p>
                     <p>There is a great many reasons why those that are the people of God should endeavor to purge out all sin out of their hearts, and not to live in any known sin, but make it their work to set themselves against every sinful way. But the thing that I am now to shew, is, How the Hopes that they have of seeing the face of God, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying so much mercy from God another day, is that which doth clense their hearts: we have divers Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures for this end, to shew that this is that which clenses the hearts of the Saints; in <hi>Psal.</hi> 37. 3. the Scripture
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:118704:83"/> joyns these two together, as having a special relation one unto another, <hi>Trust in the Lord, and do good;</hi> doing good is the fruit of trusting or hoping in the Lord, for Hope is the daughter of Faith; and in <hi>Psal. 78. 7. That they might set their Hope in God, and not forget the Works of God, but keep his Commandements:</hi> That they might set their Hope in God: what follows that? and not forget his Works, but keep his Commandements: That soul that sets his Hope in God, will not forget his Works, but endeavor to keep his Commandements: so in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3▪ 15. there likewise ye have these two to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, <hi>But sanctifie ye the Lord in your hearts, and be ready to give an account to every man that asketh you a reason of the Hope that is in you, with meekness and fear, kaving a good conscience:</hi> Those that are able to give a reason of the Hope that is in them, they are such as have a good conscience; a good conscience and a groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Hope is alwaies joyned together. That man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that hath not a good conscience, is not able to give a reason of the Hope that is in them; you say, you hope that God will have mercy upon you, and all will be well at last; but can you give a reason of your Hope? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly upon that all depends, for if your Hopes should fail, you are lost for ever; Are you able to give a reason of it? will you lay the weight of your eternal Estate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that which you are not able to give a good reason of? Every man and woman when they think of the Hope of Gods Mercies, should say, what reason am I able to give of it? Certainly your Hopes must be examined one day before the Lord and his blessed Angels and Saints, they must be examined, and therefore it is good for you now to think what reason you are able to give of it; if there be not a good conscience, there can be no reason given of it: We might name many reasons this way, how these two are joyned together, Hope and Godliness; but that the main work to shew you what there is in this hope that works the heart unto Holiness, and that causes the heart
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:118704:83"/> to purifie its self even as Christ is pure.</p>
                     <p>The first is this, <hi>He that hath this Hope purges him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self as Christ is pure.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>First, Because it is so great a Hope, as it is whereso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is truly, it is a Hope of such great and high things, the wonderful and glorious things that are the Objects of this Hope cannot but purge the heart from the filth of sin. Oh the difference that there is in the state of the soul before this Hope came into it, and when this Hope is in it, before I was a vile wretched worm, one that was a child of wrath, and under the curse of the Law, one li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to all the fruits of Gods eternal wrath, to be a cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>away for ever for ought I knew, and the Lord now hath given me Hopes that I shall see his face with joy, that all my sins are pardoned, that my soul is accepted, that I am one that belongs to his eternal election, one that he hath separated for good; I hope I am one that shall have the fruit of all the purchase of the blood of Jesus Christ, that I shall live for ever with God to enjoy communion with him, that I shall be with Christ in his Kingdom to all Eternity, and have a crown of glory incorruptible, that I shall joyn with Saints and Angels to be eternally blessing and praising God in the highest Heavens, I have hopes of such things as these are: Certainly the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Hopes of the Saints, hath a great deal of effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy in it for the purging of the heart, and that upon these grounds, because the Hopes are Hopes of such great things. Only one Scripture that the greatness of the Hopes of the Saints is that which causes them to purge themselves from the filth of sin: the text is in <hi>Tit. 2. 11, 12, 13. For the Grace of God that bringeth Salvation hath appeared to all men, teaching us that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world, loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king for the blessed Hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God, and our Savior Jesus Christ.</hi> The Grace of God hath appeared: What doth it teach us?
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:118704:84"/> To deny ungodliness and worldly lusts, and to live so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly, righteously, and godly in this present world; not to reserve our godliness for the world to come: And what's the ground of this? Looking for that blessed Hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God, and our Savior Jesus Christ.</p>
                     <p>There are these three or four Particulars in this, that the greatness of the Hopes of the Saints is that which causes them to purifie themselves.</p>
                     <p>As first, The Hopes of the Saints being so great, such things, as indeed were they not revealed in the Word were blasphemy to hope for, that ever such a creature should come to enjoy so much as this Hope doth raise up the heart to expect from God.</p>
                     <p>Now it doth first elevate the heart, because the things are so high that the soul hopes for; the heart of a man or woman before God puts in these Hopes, lies grovelling upon the ground, and even the curse of the Serpent is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on such a one, upon his belly he goes, and dust he eats, he knows no other things than these that are in the world, and therefore his heart closes with them; but these Hopes they elevate and raise up the heart on high, because the things are high; as men that are busied about high things, you know they scorn the baseness that there is in others; men that are busied about high State Affairs in the Nation, they scorn the sordidness that there is in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men whose business is altogether about low and mean things. Commonly mens spirits are according to the Objects that they are busied about, as those kind of people that have not other Objects to be busied about but scraping of dust-heaps, and raking of channels, they have low spirits; but men that are bred in other things, as in the knowledg of the Heavens, or State Affairs, they have spirits elevated accordingly: Now the Hopes of the Saints being such great and glorious things, do elevate the spirits of the children of God, and makes them scorn baseness; sin, it is baseness, and of all things in the world
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:118704:84"/> their hearts must be above sin, that is the greatest base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in the world, that which carnal hearts account their chiefest good; the Saints scorn that which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them, and under them; there is in the hearts of the Saints, a holy kind of elevation of Spirit that God loves, that is, that they should think themselves too good for those base, low, and sordid things, that the men of the world take delight in: Surely a man would think it a very sad thing to have his child love to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Swine in the Hogs-stie, and be slapping with them in the Swill-tub; a man that is of any worth would account it a great affliction to have his child of such a low spirit, but he would have him of a higher Nature, and to scorn that: So the Hopes of the Saints puts an ingenious spirit into that which is suitable to the things that he hopes for. I remember I have read in <hi>Ambrose,</hi> he reports of one <hi>Theodosa</hi> (a godly and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Virgin Maid) that she being put upon to sacrifice to the Idol gods, refused it, and the Judges to invent some kind of torment to force her to do it, they could think of nothing that would more provoke her than this, To condemn her to the Stews, that she should go and live in the Stews, that she should go and live in the Stews, and so have her Body abused there; that was the Judgment that they would condemn her to, for that they thought would prevail with her above any thing; and when she was to go thither, and some others likewise with her, they made a great fire, and put it to their choice, either to be cast into this fire, or to go to the Stews; and when they saw it, they freely leap't themselves into the fire, rather than to go into that place of uncleanness: Thus you see what spirits the people of God have, how much above they are, that which the world accounts happiness: many filthy, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, wretched hearts, will venture the loss of God and all for to satisfie the flesh in uncleanness, and think it the greatest joy and contentment that they can have to
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:118704:85"/> satisfie the flesh in filthiness and uncleanness, if they might have liberty: but now we see the spirits of these, that they account that the greatest misery, for their hearts were elevated above such base things. And that is the first thing, The greatness of the Hopes of the Saints, doth elevate and raise them higher above the base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of sin.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The Hopes of the Saints, because they are such great things that they hope for, therefore it must needs be that they must be jealous and fearful of every thing that any way may contradict their Hopes, because their Hopes are Hopes of such high and great things as they are indeed; the Hopes of carnal hearts are low and mean things, and therefore they are not so fearful and jealous of that which may hinder them, because they do not see the reality of such blessed and glorious things, as the Saints do that they Hope for; but now when it is hoping for a Kingdom, Glory, Immortality, Eternal Communion with Father, Son, and Holy Spirit in the highest Heavens, certainly any thing in the world that may be a crossing to this Hope, the hearts of the Saints must needs rise against: Now sin in its own Nature is such as would deprive the Saints of the enjoyment of these Hopes; howsoever, through the strength of the Covenant of Grace, God carries them on, that they shall not utterly be deprived, but yet they see that sin of its own nature would undo them.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The greatness of their Hopes doth fill their hearts with so much comfort, and so much satisfaction, their souls are so satisfied with the good that they hope for, that they account they have enough, so that they need not shark out to any other thing for comfort and contentment, because they have enough in their own hearts; their Hopes doth fill their souls with joy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable and glorious. What's the reason why carnal hearts that seek up and down for comfort in this lust and the other lust? Because they have not enough in
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:118704:85"/> God: But now the Saints they have the Spring of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation within, through these Hopes, these Hopes do fill them with so much comfort that the temptation that would draw them to sin, hath no power to prevail against them; for where lies the power of a temptation to sin but in this, It doth proffer some contentment that the heart had not before? and therefore people that are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented are objects of temptation, and you do not know how liable you make your selves to temptations, when you are discontented and want comfort within; the Devil when he sees such an one, saith, here's an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject fit for me, he wants comfort, now I will go and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent some comfort to him, for he is vext and troubled, and I may draw him to such and such an evil way; there's no people in more danger of temptations than melancholly and discontented persons, for the strength of a temptation lies in the proffering some contentment that I want: now if the heart be filled with comfort, and Spiritual and Heavenly things, that I find my soul fully satisfied and quieted, that I can say, <hi>Return unto thy rest, O my soul, for the Lord hath dealt bountifully with me,</hi> for whatsoever I want in the Creature I have the light of the face of God, and I know I have enough laid up in God, and Christ, and in Heaven, and the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and the Promises▪ now the Devil sees that there's little Hope of prevailing with such a soul to draw it to sin; what shall I offer contentment to them, their hearts are satisfied with better contentments than I can offer to them; but here's the ground why a temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation prevails, because the Devil thinks that he hath better comforts and contentments than you have in your own hearts; but the Devil, and World, and Flesh (put them all together) cannot offer better and sweeter com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts than this Hope in the hearts of the Saints doth fill them withal; and hence it is that the greatness of the Hopes of the Saints help to purge and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                        </gap>art from sin, because they do fill the heart with so much joy
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:118704:86"/> and comfort. If a man should have his body fill'd with sweet Wines, if you should come now to offer him a little dead smal Beer, do you think you could prevail with him to drink it? The Saints have the rich Wine of Heavenly consolation, and they do fill themselves through the Hopes that they have in those great things of the Gospel; they do fill their hearts with the rich Wine of the consolation of the Spirit of God, and that which the Devil, or World, or Flesh offer, it's but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle sapless stuff, dead Beer, after they are so filled with other comforts.</p>
                     <p>In the last place, The greatness of the Hopes of the Saints doth purge their hearts, because it doth inflame their spirits with love to God; Oh that ever God should look upon such a worm, a vile wre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                        </gap> and clenses, so the Love of God is hot in the heart, it is as a fire in the very bones, Oh it purifies the heart from the dross that before was in it, the Love of God being shed abroad in the soul, there's nothing in the World clenses so as that doth: And that's the first ground of the purifying of the heart by these Hopes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:118704:86"/> they are so great Hopes, and therefore he that hath this Hope purifies himself.</p>

                        <p>The Second Ground why the Saints Hopes makes them purifie themselves: Because their Hopes (usually) cost them very dear.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THe Second ground is this, He that hath this Hope purifies himself, because his Hopes cost him dear; the Hopes of the Saints, they do cost them very dear usually, and therefore they are loth to lose them, they are careful to maintain them, knowing how dear they cost them; though I do not say, but somtimes God doth even sanctifie from the womb, and so by degrees raiseth the heart to hope, but even these find it cost them dear to maintain their Hopes, ordinarily it cost them dear to get them, and to maintain them; it costs them a great deal of humiliation before, it costs them many prayers, many tears; much pains taking, much sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Word, and the Covenant of Grace, and after a long time it is that their he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>rts are somwhat raised with Hope: those that for the most part have these Hopes can remember in what a sad condition they were in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had them, when their hearts were even despai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and what a great deal of labor, and pains, and cost that they were at, before they came to have their hearts raised with these Hopes: now when they have gotten them with much difficulty and pains, they think, shall I lose them for nothing?

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nce it is that they are so careful to preserve it; and therefore because they see that the filth and defilement of fin would hinder their Hopes, and take away the comfort of that, therefore they set them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves so much against their sin; whereas the Hopes of the greatest part of the world, are things that lightly come, and lightly go, they cost them nothing: I appeal to you, what do your Hopes cost you? what pains did you take before you attained to these Hopes? for this is certain, all men and women in the World are the children of wrath by Nature, therefore the Hopes that are Hopes of a right stamp, usually cost you dear; but you that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther know what they cost you, nor how they are to be maintained; no marvel therfore though you can lose the comforts of your Hopes, and though they purge not your hearts, though your Hopes may stand with the way of sin and wickedness; because your Hopes are so light things, you easily get them, and so you can easily part with them; you can commit sin, and still you hope the Lord will be merciful unto you, and sin again, and hope again; your Hopes come light, and go light away▪ But the Saints they get their Hopes by prayer and watchfulness, care, and examination of their hearts, and the Word, and if at any time they fall into sin, they lose the comfort, and the sence of their Hope, and then they are fain to seek again, as if they were new to begin; and when was there euer any that had true Grace that have fallen as I have done? and so they are many times in their own apprehension forced to begin all afresh: now when they see what their sins puts them to, and how it
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:118704:87"/> doth eclipse or obscure their Hopes, and cost them so dear, this is it that makes them take heed what they do. In <hi>Ezra,</hi> 9. we read of that holy man, making this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument in the 8. verse, <hi>And now for a little space Grace hath been shewed from the Lord our God, to leave us a remnant to escape, and to give us a nail in his holy place, that our God may lighten our eyes and give us a little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving in our bondage: Should we again break thy Commandements?</hi> For so he speaks upon the strength of what he said in verse 8. As if <hi>Ezra</hi> should have said, Oh Lord, we were in great bondage, and it was a mighty work of thine ever to deliver us so far as we are delivered, and to give us a nail in thy holy place, and a little revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in our bondage; and Lord, shall we again forsake thee, and break thy Commandements? here's an ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous kind of arguing: Just so is the arguing of a gracious heart about his Hope, Oh Lord God, I that was in bondage, and had the Spirit of bondage upon me, and saw my self as a bondslave to sin, and to the Devil, and now Lord hast thou by thine Almighty power, and by thine infinite Grace and mercy given me a little Hope that thou dost intend good unto me in Jesus Christ, and will save this soul of mine, and bring me to Heaven and eternal life, and should I again forsake thee, and break thy Commandements? should I again return to those former sins I lived in that cost me so dear, that made such a breach between the infinite God and my soul when the Lord hath been pleased to deliver me, and give me such Hope: was there not a time that I would have given ten thousand worlds if I had had them for the raising of my heart from the gulf of despair that I saw my self sinking into? and hath the Lord been pleased to give unto me a little reviving, and shall I again break the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? Oh here's a strong Argument that an ingenious, gracious heart makes use of, from the Hope that God doth give unto him, the little reviving that God gives unto him, because the Lord hath given it with much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:118704:88"/> it was a wonderful work of God ever to raise him to these Hopes that he is raised to; and indeed one that hath this Hope doth admire at Gods infinite mercy that he hath been pleased to make such an alteration in his condition; Oh that such a one as I was can be able to look upon the face of the infinite and just God with Hope, and to smile upon Death, the King of Terrors, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the great day of Judgment with Hope, Oh he doth admire at Gods Grace in it, and therefore he is loth to lose the comfort of it; and hence it is he comes to purge himself, he hath from hence a strong Argument against every kind of sin whatsoever: and that's the second thing whereby a gracious heart purifies himself from sin, upon the Hope that he hath.</p>

                        <p>The Third Ground why the Saints Hope makes them purifie themselves: Beeause their Hope is a Scripture Hope.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THe Third thing is this, The Hopes of one that is godly doth purge from sin, because it is a Scripture Hope: the Saints when they Hope in God, they do not hope in a confused way, they build not their Hopes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Sand, but they look into the Word of God, and they build their Hopes upon the Scripture; hence then it must needs follow, that therefore their Hopes must be according to the tenure of the Scripture, and if they be so, they must needs be purging Hopes. That they build their Hopes upon the Scripture, is evident in <hi>Psal. 119. 41. Let thy mercy come also unto me O Lord, even thy
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:118704:88"/> Salvation according to the Word.</hi> It's a very notable Scripture if you observe it; as if <hi>David</hi> should say, Oh Lord, for my part I never expect Mercy nor Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but according to thy Word, I never look for it upon any other terms, but meerly according to thy Word, let me have thy mercy, and thy Salvation according to thy Promise, and no otherwise; if so be that thy Word will not give it me, if I have it not upon the terms of thy Word, Lord, I am content to be without it: I put this to every one of you, and desire you that you would make use of this in your own consciences; see whether you have <hi>Davids</hi> spirit or no, Lord, I hear out of thy Word such and such things upon such and such terms, thou hast promised mercy to people that are thus and thus, and Lord God, I am content to venture my soul upon that, never to look upon thy face with any expectation of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy but so as the Word shall bear me out in it, and if thy Word shall not encourage me, let me not have it: In the 81. verse of this Psalm, <hi>My soul fainteth for thy Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but I hope in thy Word:</hi> still it is the Word that is the ground of the Hopes of the Saints; and in <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. that known place, which you have for this, in the 4. verse, <hi>Whatsoever things were written afore time were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten for our learning, that we through patience and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of the Scriptures might have Hope;</hi> so that the Hopes of the Saints are Scripture Hopes; now upon that it must needs be that they are purging Hopes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that the Scripture doth hold forth no ground of Hope but upon such terms of purging and purifying them. Therefore in <hi>Isa.</hi> 1. 16. where the ground for the Hopes of mercy is held forth, <hi>Wash you, make you clean, put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes, cease to do evil, learn to do well, seek Judgment, relieve the oppressed, judg the fatherless, plead for the widdow; Come now and let us reason together saith the Lord, though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:118704:89"/> wool:</hi> Observe, God will not so much as parly the case with any sinner for the doing away of their sins till they come to a resolution to wash them and make them clean, and put away the evil of their doings, and cease to do evil, Come now and let us reason together saith God, there's no thought that you should have any hope of any mercy from me till you find your selves willing to put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes.</p>
                     <p>Certainly though we cannot say that before the soul clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses with Gods mercy in Christ, there is an actual sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, yet this we may say, that before the soul hath any comfort to ground upon, hath any grounded Hope that ever God should put away his sins, there must be wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, there must be making clean, and putting away the evil of their doings, and ceasing to do evil, and learning to do well; this is the Scripture way of raising of the Hope of the Saints: If we would reason the case with God, we must come with such resolutions; and indeed when the soul doth first beleeve, it comes as well to Christ for wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing away of the evil of sin, as for washing away of the guilt of sin, if it be Scripture Hope, it must needs be a purging Hope; and upon this ground those that have this Hope do purge themselves, because grounding their Hopes upon the Scriptures they find that the tenure of the Scripture runs so, that they that will have the blessing of the Covenant of Grace must be sanctified: So in <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 33. how doth the tenure of the Covenant of Grace run there? <hi>This shall be the Covenant that I will make with the House of Israel after those daies (saith the Lord) I will put my Law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts, and will be their God, and they shall be my people:</hi> Have you Hope that God will be your God? the terms upon which this goes, and the tenure of this Covenant is this, That God will write his Law in their inward parts: what's that? that is, he will give you a gracious frame of spirit, that there shall be an inward sympathy between your hearts, and whatsoever is written
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:118704:89"/> in the Law of God, there shall be a disposition in your hearts sutable to what is written in Gods Law, whensoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver God doth enter into Covenant with your souls he doth thus; if your Hopes be according to what is written in the Scripture they must needs be clensing and purify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; the truth is, the Scriptures doth dash the Hopes of the wicked and ungodly: As let them but read such Scriptures as these, as in <hi>Rom. 1. 18. For the wrath of God is revealed from Heaven against all ungodliness:</hi> what say you to this Scripture? will your Hopes stand with this Scripture? and in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 9. there you have reckoned up a great many several sorts of sinners, <hi>and none of all these shall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven:</hi> and <hi>Rom. 8. 13. For if ye live after the flesh, you shall die;</hi> he that seeks to satisfie the flesh, and the lusts of the flesh shall die, shall perish: will your Hopes stand with this Scripture yea or no? And so in <hi>Heb. 12. 14. Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Peace with all men, and Holiness, without which none shall see the Lord:</hi> Can your Hopes stand with that Scripture? It's certain the Hopes of the Saints may stand with every Scripture, with every verse in all the Book of God. You will say, some Scriptures speak terribly to me, but others speaks comfortably; but if thy Hopes be right, they may stand▪ with every line and word; there's nothing in all the Book of God that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst thy Hopes; and this again is a certain Truth, <hi>That if it shall prove at the day of Judgment, there be but one verse in all the Book of God against thy Hopes, thou art undone for ever;</hi> do but consider of this thing and lay it up, If when thy Hopes of Eternal Life comes to be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined at the great Day, there be found but one verse in all the Book of God that is against thy Hopes, thou art a lost and undone man or woman for ever; whatever conceits thou had'st before that all might be well with thee, whatsoever other people did think of thee, yet one Scripture at the great day will cast thee for ever▪ Now thy Hopes must be Scripture Hopes, and must be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:118704:90"/> to the tenure and way of the Scripture, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore purging Hopes.</p>

                           <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The Hope of the Saints must needs be a purifying Hope, Because it's a lively Hope. <hi>Fiftly,</hi> The Hope of the Saints must be purifying because they are pitcht upon God and Jesus Christ.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>FOurthly, The Hopes of the Saints must needs he purging, because they are lively Hopes: that known place that we made use of divers times, in 1 <hi>Pet. 1. 3. We are begotten to a lively Hope;</hi> it is alwaies living, and therefore working, and how doth the liveliness of the Hopes of the Saints appear but by working out corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? as the living Fountain, how doth it appear to be living but by continual working? in the high way as you come along, there the water▪ lies together with the dirt; but if there were a spring that had so much dirt in it, if you stay but an hour, you shall have it run as cleer as it was before: Nothing doth more lively express the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the sins of the Saints, and the sins of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men, as dirt in water in the high way, and dirt cast into a living spring: So the Hopes of the Saints are lively, and not only living, but lively; a man may be a living man, but yet not lively; but now the Hopes of the Saints, they are both living Hopes, and lively Hopes; living Hopes, they are part of the new Nature, of the spirit of Life that God doth put into the soul, that is in Scripture call'd the Life of God, and therefore very active and stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and so they are not only part of that life, but live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Hopes that have continual matter for to quicken and feed them, and it's the care of the Saints to be feeding
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:118704:90"/> their Hopes, and to keep them in a lively plight, because the very joy of their lives depends upon their Hopes: Continual action and stirring keeps from corruption; the Hopes of the Saints are lively, but the Hopes of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked are dead, dull kind of Hopes, and therefore may stand with their corruptions.</p>
                     <p>In the fift place, The Hopes of the Saints must be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying Hopes because they are pitcht upon God, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Jesus Christ: I might give you many Scriptures for that, upon their pitching upon God, that former 78. <hi>Psalm,</hi> 7, and 8. verses, and in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 21, 22. I shall not need to name the words, but their Hopes are pitch'd upon God; and in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. beginning, <hi>Christ our Hope;</hi> pitcht upon Jesus Christ; observe, how these must needs purifie; those Hopes that are pitch't upon God whereby the soul converses much with God and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, they must needs purifie. The more any heart acts upon God, and upon Christ, and converses with them, they must needs have their hearts very pure; you complain of your corruptions, and a great deal of filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes abides stil in you; would you know the way to purge your hearts? Oh let your spirits be much exercised with God, and with Jesus Christ: When a gracious heart hath been between God and it in meditation in any ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly duty, and hath found the ability to raise the heart to have any communion with God and Jesus Christ, Oh it can come from those duties with mighty strong resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons against sin, and can come wonderfully clensed from the dross<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ness of their spirits that they had before they did so converse with God and Christ. As <hi>Moses</hi> when he was in the Mountain and conversed with God, he came down with his face shining, why? because he had been conversing much with God: So those that converse much with God they have shining hearts, and shining conversations: The reason of the dulness and drousiness of your hearts and conversations, it is, because you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse much with the world; but conversing with God
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:118704:91"/> and with Christ the holy one of God, it will clense and purifie your hearts. In <hi>Job,</hi> 11. 14, and 15. verses, <hi>If iniquity be in thine hand, put it far away, and let not wickedness dwell in thy Tabernacles, for then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot:</hi> Thou canst not lift up thy face without spot, and fear and trembling, except iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty being in thine hand thou put it away far from thee; that man that would with a free heart converse with God, which would lift up his face to God with joy, and would have a steadfast heart without fear, that man if he hath iniquity in his hand he must put it away, and let not wickedness dwell in his Tabernacle, it cannot stand together; if there be any wickedness in thy house, in thy Tabernacle; if thou wilt not lose thy freedom in thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse with God, put it away, for certainly it cannot stand both together. Now the Hopes of the Saints doth purge out wickedness, because by their Hopes they converse so much with God and Christ, and are acting so much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them: Hence it is that they do purge and clense their hearts.</p>
                     <p>Further, The Hopes of the Saints they are Hopes in the Holy Ghost; as in <hi>Romans, 15. 13, 14 By the power of the Holy Ghost.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again, You heard before, they were grounded upon Faith, and Faith purifies the heart; Hope is the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Faith, and therefore hath the efficacy of Faith in it, those things were before, but these things shew where the influence of this purifying quality of Hope is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is wrought by the power of the Holy Ghost, and hath the ground of it by Faith: I shall give you but only these two Arguments more, and then come to the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>Two more Grounds why the Saints Hope makes them purifie themselves. <hi>First,</hi> Because the things hoped for, are such pure and holy things. <hi>Lastly,</hi> Because the purging of the heart is but a preparation for the enjoyment of all the Good a gracious heart hopes for.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>FIrst, If we consider what are the holy things that the soul doth hope for, that is, the Objects of Hope, as before the greatness of the things, so the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves true saving Hope pitches upon, they are things so holy and pure, that it cannot be but that the Hopes of such things must needs purifie the heart as thus; I need go no further than the very verse before the Text, <hi>Now we are the Sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be, but we know when he shall appear, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is: And every man that hath this Hope in him, purifies himself, even as he is pure:</hi> He that hath this Hope, What Hope? that is, The Hope that when Jesus Christ shall appear, we shall be like Christ, and shall see him as he is; Oh one day I shall be like to Jesus Christ; the great thing that I Hope for, it is not so much that I shall for ever be freed from Hell, and the unspeakable torments of the damned; but this I hope, that though I have a wretched heart of mine own, yet I hope one day I shall be made even like to Jesus Christ himself, and I shall see Jesus Christ as he is in all his Holiness, and all his Glory, I hope for this. Certainly if these be the things that I
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:118704:92"/> hope for, then it must needs be sutable to this that I must labor to be as like Christ as I can; if so be that people did but understand what they mean when they say they hope to go to Heaven, it could not but cause them to purge themselves from sin and wickedness; thou hopest to go to Heaven, what dost thou hope for in Heaven? truly that we cannot tell, but we shall be happy and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious; but what is it? If God hath acquainted thy soul with true Hope, this is thy happiness, That thou shalt be for ever in Heaven with Jesus Christ, and be like him, and thou shalt see him in his holiness and glory, that thou hopest for; that is the happiness of Heaven that thou rejoycest in every time thou thinkest of: Certainly, if thou canst rejoyce in this Hope, then the soul should labor to be as like Christ as it can be: that which I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count should be the glory of Heaven to my soul, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if thy heart be in Heaven, thou wouldest be glad to have as much of Heaven here on Earth as thou canst for the present.</p>
                     <p>The last thing is this, Surely he that hath this Hope must needs purge himself, because the purging of the soul is but a preparation for the enjoyment of all the good a gracious heart hopes for: now if it hopes for it, it must needs follow that it will labor to prepare for that it hopes for: as thus, Suppose there hath been a treaty of a Match between two, if it be quite off, and there be little hopes that it will go on, they never trouble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves about preparation for it; but when there is a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a Match, and it begins to go on hopefully, and they have ground fully to perswade themselves that it wil pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, and they expect the very day when the Solemnize shall be, now they begin to think of preparation, of their cloathes, and of their friends, and where they should keep their Marriage Feast; then they begin to prepare when once they make account that the thing will go on, and that the day is appointed: Thus is the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween those that are Carnal and Spiritual; you that are
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:118704:92"/> carnal, perhaps you hear of Christ, and of a match be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the soul and Christ in the general; but the holy Spirit comes, and not only reveals such a thing in general, but comes and perswades the soul, though very poor and wretched in its self, yet perswades this soul, well, God the Father intends his son to be a Match for you, and the thing it is determined in Heaven, that thou art the soul that shalt enjoy Jesus Christ for thy husband to all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and the glory of Jesus Christ shall be upon thee, and the time is appointed when Jesus Christ shall come with all his glory for the full Solemnity of this Match, and to take thy soul and body to himself to live for evermore with him in those mansions he is gone to prepare: now when the soul comes first to beleeve this, and beleeving this, then comes to have Hope raised, and hopes for that day coming, the soul thinks, what must I do to prepare my self then for this Bridegroom? how shall I fit my self for this day of the coming of Jesus Christ? It is indeed as excellent a sign of true Grace as any one I know, when the heart is taken off from other things, and now hath such a cleer manifestation of Christ, and such Faith and Hope in Christ, and of the part that it shall have in Christ, and communion with him: the great care and work of such a soul in the whol course of its Life here, is nothing else but to prepare it self for the meeting of this Bridegroom, to meet with Jesus Christ, and so to meet with him as to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy everlasting communion with him, whereas before my thoughts and care was about this and the other thing in the world, to make provision for my self though I may follow my calling in an orderly way as before I came to Christ, yet the strength of my soul is upon this great work, to prepare my soul to meet with Jesus Christ when he comes, that I may be presented blameless before him at his coming, whensoever it shall be, I have Hopes of this glorious Match; the great day of Judgment that shall be the day of horror and vexation of ungodly and wicked men, shall be the day of the glorious Match of my soul to
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:118704:93"/> Christ, and therefore what is the course of my life, and the care of my heart, but to prepare my soul for this time? other men and women may be busied about this matter, and the other business, but the work that I have to do is to prepare my soul for the coming of Jesus Christ that I do expect to behold, and be made like unto him; now can this stand with the living in any way of known sin? it's impossible but where there are such things as these are, such a soul must purifie himself as he is pure.</p>

                        <p>HEnce in the first plaee: Certainly then, those Hopes are to be reproved that are so far from pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging from sin that they are the great nourishers of sin; they are abominable Hopes, they are therefore wicked because they have so much Hopes; if they did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that God were so merciful as he is, they would be
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:118704:93"/> more careful of their lives than they are: Now this is a desperate kind of beleeving, for men to be the more wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked because they beleeve God is the more merciful, and yet I dare appeal to most people, if you did think that God were not so merciful as he is, if you did beleeve that God were more severe than indeed you do beleeve, would not you be more careful of your waies? we see it by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience that at such times when men have least Hopes, that is, upon the sick bed, and death bed, and that the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Ice is cracking, and they are ready to be swallowed up of the gulf of eternal misery as they think, Oh then they would be godly, and be purging themselves, but when they have health and peace, and have some Hopes, now they are ungodly, so that the best condition that many people are in, is when they are most in despair, when they are ready to die, when their Hopes are most shak'd, then are they in the best tune: Oh but it's otherwise with the Saints; when their Hopes are most raised, then are their hearts most sanctified, and that's an excellent sign, it's as good a sign of Grace as any. If thou canst say thus, Blessed be God, when my Hopes are most rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, then is my heart most sanctified; the Scripture doth speak abundance of peace and comfort to such a soul.</p>

                        <p>The Second Use is this, If such Hopes do purifie, hence we have warrant for to labor to get the hearts of the most vile sinners in the world to beleeve, and so to get hope of Gods Mercy; we have warrant to open the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of Grace to the vilest sinners in the world, and to labor to draw their hearts at the very first unto Jesus Christ, and to these Hopes, because that the very Hopes will purge as much as any thing; we can never use any means to purge their hearts so much as by shewing them the Grace of God that they may Hope in. But you wil say, that hope cannot stand with living in sin &amp; corruption.
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:118704:94"/> No, but the way to get the soul from sin and corruption, it is the manifestation of the Object of this glorious Hope of the Saints to the soul, the very first work that shall draw the heart to beleeve and hope in Jesus Christ, will draw the heart from the love of every sin and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption whatsoever.</p>

                        <p>A third Use might be to help the Saints against that great temptation and discouragement that they have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there is so much sin and corruption in their hearts, they think that therefore it is presumption for them to beleeve because their corruptions are so great; this point may help against that temptation. Certainly it is not presumption for thee to beleeve and Hope if it doth purge thy heart, why art thou afraid that it is presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Oh, because I have such a naughty and vile heart, therefore it's presumption for me to hope: but if I can say, because thou dost hope thou shalt not have so naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty a heart, certainly it's as pleasing to God that we should have a better heart by hoping, as well as have a better heart, and then hope, yea, it's more Evangelical to have a purged heart by hoping, than to hope because I have a purged heart; in the other thou goest on in a more legal way, to say, I'le first be purged, and then I'le hope, but if thou canst say, I'le first hope, and then my hope shall purge me: Oh go that way to understand Hope, and then thou wilt find as much and more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in that way than in the other.</p>

                        <p>Again, Oh how doth it cut the sinews almost of all false Hope, for they neither are purged, neither do they hope, and so are purged, purged they are, neither before
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:118704:94"/> Hope, nor after their Hope; and when it is neither of both, then certainly those Hopes can never do good to the soul in the day of Jesus Christ. The Scripture compares the Hopes of the wicked to the Spiders Web, in <hi>Job,</hi> 8. 14. A great deal of pains you know a Spider takes in making the Web, and then comes the Beesom of the Maid, and one dash takes it all away: So there's many people spin out their Hopes, and they spin them out of themselves as the Spider doth, and not out of the Word, nor out of the bowels of Jesus Christ, but out of themselves, their good meanings, their good actions, their good serving of God, and a fine Web is made; but when the Beesom of death comes, it's all dash't; <hi>When a wicked man dies, his Hopes perish,</hi> Prov. 11. 7. In <hi>Job,</hi> 14. 19. there the Hopes of the wicked are compared to a thing that grows out of the dust; and indeed the Hopes of wicked men they grow out of the very dust, they grow not out of the Word, and the Covenant of Grace, but out of the dust, and therefore they quickly vanish and come to nothing. Those two are joyned together in <hi>Eph. 2. 12. Without God, and without Hope:</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly abundance of people live without God in the world, and yet they will say, they have Hope; but if without God in the world, then certainly you are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Hope, without this true saving Hope: now the hopes therfore of the most people in the world, certainly they are vanishing things, and will come to nothing.</p>
                        <p>For first, They hope, but their Hope is a meer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction; as thus, Suppose a man should go into his ploughed field, and sow Tares in the field, well saith he, I hope I shall have as good a crop of Wheat as any man in all the Country; would not any man in the world think that man mad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> that should hope for Wheat when he lowed Tares? Certainly the hopes of Heaven and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life in most people are as foolish and as contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory in themselves as this kind of Hope. What dost thou sow in thy life? thou sowest nothing but wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:118704:95"/> in the course of thy life, and yet thou hopest for Heaven, and Glory, and Immortality, and the like, when as the Scripture tells thee plainly, <hi>As a man soweth, so shall he reap;</hi> and there's a most wicked presumption in thy Hope, for thee to go on in hope, and on in sin, I say, there is an impious wicked presumption in thy hope, and it doth provoke God exceedingly against the soul, that he cannot but with indignation look upon such a heart as vile and wretched, and he will cast thee off (one day) with indignation. If a man should come and say, Sir, I do depend upon you for help in such a business, and I am undone if you help me not, for all my expectation is upon you; presently I direct him in a way that he shall go; now if he should go quite contrary to what I give him directions about, and yet say he hopes that I will help him, would not any man account himself mock'd in this case? Truly in this manner do wicked and ungodly men mock God to his very face. God doth protest in the most solemn manner that is possible for any to protest that such and such that do such things, they shall never inherit the Kingdom of Heaven; hope and hope as much as you will, yet in such a way if I be a God you shall perish; and yet saith one, I hope that God will not do as he saith; you dare not say so openly, but in effect you do, in your hearts you say so: this is a mocking God to his very face; but God will not be mock'd. And know, there's a great deal more evil in vain hopes than you are aware of, it doth dishonor God in his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, it's apparant that you do not know as yet what an infinite holy God it is that you have to deal with, God takes this extream ill at thy hands, and looks upon this wickedness of thy heart with indignation, that thou shouldest da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>LAst Use. If this be so, That thy Hopes cannot stand without purifying thy self, and the laboring for the greatest exactness; to be pure as Christ is pure, cannot stand with the walking in the way of sin, of filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and corruption; Oh then away with thy sin, wilt thou yet dare after the knowledg of all this, wilt thou yet dare to please thy self in any way of wickedness? shall not thy heart from this day forwards be set against every
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:118704:96"/> false way? shall it not go away with such resolutions? Well, the Lord forbid that there should be any one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved▪ in that I should entertain again; for time to come it shall be the uttermost degree of strictness and holiness that I will endeavor after, even to purifie my self as Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ is pure, for I have read that there can be no Hopes of Heaven and Eternal Life without purifying my self, and endeavoring to purifie my self even as Jesus Christ is pure; I will never cry out of strictness or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciseness and Puritanism again, but I will set my self with all my power to imitate the pattern of Jesus Christ the Holy One: Will you go away with such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions as this is? Oh blessed be God then that ever you lived to hear or read of this Point; and there's a great deal of strength in it to cause you to cast away your beloved sins with indignation, and even say, get you hence, what have I to do any more with Idols, this lust, that corruption? because otherwise they will disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point you of all your hope of Eternal▪ Life that you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect. If you had a dear friend that were willing to set you up in trading, and whatever you would you might come to him for; but if he should say thus to you, I require this at your hands, do not accompany with such a fellow, if you do keep company with him you shall never see my face; now would not this be an argument to perswade you to cast off the company of any one if you had a friend that might enrich you? God saith in the same manner, if you be one that hath Hope; the truth is, you have Hope in God to have all the Riches that there are in God himself that you are capable of, and God is willing to bestow them upon you, I but saith he, do not you accompany with such a one, let not your heart entertain such a wicked lust as you find so sutable to your nature, for if you do, you shall never see my face, you shall never see any good in me, nor in my▪ Son; now will you yet venture upon any beloved sin for all this? is there so much good to be had in any corruption as to
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:118704:96"/> countervail the loss of your Hopes? Truly, when I meditate upon this Point, I see God, and even hear him crying to wretched and wicked sinners that live in wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and wallow in their filthy lusts, God is crying to them, Oh wretched sinner, if ever thou would'st have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny part in me, to have any good of all the Riches that I have in Heaven or Earth, then cast away thy beloved sin saith God. And so from this Point Christ doth as it were cry to sinners, Oh wretched sinful men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, would you have any hope ever to enjoy any good in what I have purchased by my blood? if you would have any hope for the enjoyment of it, cast away your sins, cast away your wickedness; yea, your very souls are before you crying to you, would you have us not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish eternally? would you have us to have any hope of seeing the face of God with joy, and to have happiness when we are departed from this Body? then cast away such and such beloved corruptions, for our seeing the face of God with joy cannot stand with them. Now that soul that after all this shall yet keep any way of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness▪ any beloved sin still, how just were it with God▪ with Jesus Christ, with the Saints and Angels, and their own consciences to cry to have Justice proclaimed against this soul, It is infinitly righteous that this man or woman should perish eternally; one day it will be so. But when you hear that your hopes cannot stand without purging your souls, and aiming at the uttermost purity; yet if your hearts be so knit to the love of any base cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, that you wil venture all: this wil be the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of every wicked man and woman that shall go on in wicked waies after the reading of these Sermons: If thou should'st be so desperately wicked as to say, for all this I'le venture, I'le venture to see whether the hopes of good in Christ &amp; my lusts wil not stand together; Oh devilish heart! thou that darest put such a thing of such infinite consequence to the venture, if thou dost so, even the Saints and Angels, and thine own conscience shall eccho
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:118704:97"/> forth to God, Just art thou O God to sink such a soul in eternal despair, because he had such a love to his lusts as he would venture his soul for them, and therfore just it were that he should be eternally sunk down into <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>Now the Lord give you hearts to consider of this while yet you are in the Land of the Living, for while we are alive this time is the time of raising our Hopes; whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thou art now, yet while the Lord gives thee life, there is a possibility for the raising of thy Hopes; but if God had cut thee off in thy sin, thou had'st been lost and undone for ever: Consider therfore what the Lord prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth to thee here, seeing that the Hopes of the Saints a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the glory of Heaven is such a Hope that whosoever hath it doth purifie himself even as Jesus Christ is pure.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Apostle in the latter part of the former Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the beginning of this, shews what it was that carried him, and the rest of suffering Saints through the great and manifold afflictions that they met withal in their way to Heaven, as is evident in the 17. vers. of the 6. Chap.
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:118704:100"/> by that elegant Antithesis, &amp; a double Hyperbole beyond Englishing: <hi>For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh or prepareth for▪ us afar more excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and eternal weight of Glory:</hi> and then it follows in the next verse, <hi>While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen:</hi> It was the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercising of their eye of Faith upon the things which were not seen; and what those things are that are not seen, are shadowed out in the beginning of this 5. Chapter▪ <hi>We know that if our Earthly house of this Tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the Heavens,</hi> and this we <hi>groan for,</hi> being burdened with sin and misery: and then in the 6. verse, <hi>We are alwaies confident, knowing that whilst we are at home in the Body, we are absent from the Lord:</hi> We do not enjoy that of God that we do expect, but yet <hi>we are confident;</hi> for however things seem to work sadly in respect of outwards, yet stil we have Confidence of the great things that are to come, <hi>For we walk by Faith, and not by Sight:</hi> That's the Scope.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>We Walk▪</hi>] That is, The constant Course of our hearts, and of our lives, is acted and guided by Faith, and not by Sight: That's the meaning of <hi>Walking.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Not by sight.] Sight,</hi> that is taken either largely for <hi>Sence,</hi> not only the sight of the Eye, but for al other Sences both internal and external, one<note place="margin">In sese visus sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plectitur omnes.</note> being put for all: We do not walk by Sence, and especially by the sight of our Eyes: And this Sight or Sence hath a Twofold Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Either first considered as Carnal Sence, We do not walk according to what we see with our Eyes before us, we do not guide and steer our Course accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Or Secondly, which I think the Apostle doth as truly intend as the other; we do not walk by <hi>Spiritual</hi> Sence neither; that is, in what we feel in respect of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:118704:100"/> things; no, we have a Principle to guide and act<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> us, not only beyond Carnal Sence, but even beyond Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Sence, we are guided and acted by Faith, that's a Principle higher. And this indeed is a blessed Walk of a Christian, he doth most blessedly walk with God when he comes to be guided and acted by a Principle higher than either Carnal Sence, or Spiritual Sence.</p>
                     <p>Again, <hi>Not by Sight, but by Faith:</hi> By <hi>Sight</hi> is not only meant <hi>Sence,</hi> but <hi>Reason;</hi> we do not walk ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the sight of our Understandings: that's a higher Principle than Sence. And this likewise hath a Twofold Consideration.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Either Carnal Reason; we do not walk according to the Carnal Reason of our minds, as if we were acted by nothing else but what we apprehend by our own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Reason.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Or Secondly, We do not walk by our Spiritual Reason only, we have a Principle beyond Spiritual Knowledg: And when I come to that Point I shal shew how this is meant, not only beyond Natural Knowledg, but beyond Spiritual Knowledg; Faith goes higher than that: Now that both these are meant, Spiritual▪ Sence, and Spiritual Knowledg, it's cleer to me from that which the Apostle saith here, <hi>While we are present in the Body, we are absent from the Lord;</hi> for we walk by Faith, and not by Sence: Though now we have a confidence, and we have some knowledg of God, and of what we shall enjoy in him, but saith he, we are absent from him, we have not that Sence of it fully as we shall have, neither have we the knowledg of it fully; but our Faith goes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond our <hi>Sence</hi> of the presence of God, and goes beyond our Knowledg of God: We rise higher by our Faith than we can by our Knowledg▪ Not only <hi>Natural,</hi> but that <hi>Spiritual</hi> and Sanctified Knowledg that the Apostle had, did not reach so high as his Faith did. Thus you see the Scope and the meaning of the Apostle: In the opening of the Point we shall see it further.</p>

                     <p>FIrst, We shall treat of the Negative, What a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian doth not walk according to, in the way of his heart or life: Not according to Sight.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, We shall treat of the Positive, By what a Saint on Earth doth walk: He walks by Faith.</p>
                     <p>And Thirdly, How this walking by Faith is beyond walking by Sight.</p>
                     <p>First of the Negative, That he doth not walk by Sight. <hi>We walk by Faith, and not by Sight:</hi> A Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian walks not by sight as other men do: It doth imply this, That other men walk by Sight; but those that are Saints do not: Worldlings steer their Course, and guide their way here in this world according to Sight.</p>
                     <p>And First according to the sight of their Eyes, and their other Sences, they make that to be their way and guide.</p>
                     <p>And Secondly, According to their Natural Reason; they make that to be their guide, and go no further; But a real Christian is beyond all these, yea, he is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond his Spiritual Sence, and Sanctified Reason and Knowledg.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 First then to open to you what it is to walk by

                     <p n="2">2 And then we shall shew unto you, That they do so.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 And Thirdly, What a great evil there is in walking by Sight.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 And then, That Saints do not do as they do.</p>
                     <p>First, Then when I say that the men of the world that are Carnal, walk first by Sence, and then by Reason: They walk by Sight; I mean by that, this,</p>
                     <p n="1">1 The great good or end that a Carnal heart pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds to its self, it is some good that is the Object of Sence; for in a Walk there is propounding an end whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you would walk to; now those that are Carnal and Natural, the end that they propound to themselves is some sensual good.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 They judg of things according to Sence, and their hearts are taken and affected with things according as they are to Sence.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 And then lastly, Though they have somtimes some good motions to that which is beyond Sence, somtimes they may have some convictions, and somtimes some good affections rising in them, as the morning Cloud, and early Dew, yet the constant way and tenure of their hearts is according to Sence, and so of their lives and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, according to what they see, what they feel.</p>
                     <p>The End they propound to themselves is the good of Sence.</p>
                     <p>The Rule by which they judg, it is Sence.</p>
                     <p>That which takes their hearts, it is Sence.</p>
                     <p>The main work of their lives, it is for some good of Sence.</p>
                     <p>And though they have some Convictions, and some good Affections some times about things beyond Sence, yet the constant By as and stream of their hearts is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Sence: This is a description of a great many men, and the Course of most people, and I fear that many of

I confess the word in the Original includes both these Things that I am speaking of, Walking according to Sence, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Natural Reason; and it's the same word that is used for a Natural man in the <hi>Corinthians, A Natural man perceiveth not the things of God,</hi> a man that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by Sence, and hath meerly Natural apprehension of things: Wicked men they are carried by Sence, both yong and old; in <hi>Eccles. 11. 9.

<pb n="169" facs="tcp:118704:102"/> bidden to walk according to their hearts, and according to the sight of their Eyes, I but it is in a way of Irony, it doth carry with it a severe reprehension, Do if you dare; like as God said to <hi>Balaam, Rise up and go to Balak,</hi> Numb. 22. 20. That is, Go, if thou thinkest it good; Go, sith thou wilt needsly go; but thou goest upon thy death. Let no man imagine that it ever came in the Preachers heart here, <hi>Oleum camino addere,</hi> to ad fuel to the fire of youthful lusts, to encite yong people (unruly enough of themselves) to take their ful swing of sinful pleasures. But by an ironical Concession the wise man bids the yong man rejoyce, &amp;c. yields him what he would have, by way of mockage, and bitter scoff, like as <hi>Elias</hi> jeered the Baalites, bidding them cry aloud un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their drowsie or busie god; or as <hi>Micaiah</hi> bad <hi>Ahah, Go up against</hi> Ramoth Gilead, <hi>and prosper:</hi> or as our Savior bad his drowsie Disciples, <hi>Sleep on now, and take your rest,</hi> Mark, 14. 41. <hi>viz.</hi> if you can at least, or have any mind to it with so many Bils &amp; Halberts about your ears. So the Preacher seems to speak, as sometimes you use to say to those you reprehend sharply; I, go on and do thus, and see what will come of it at last; that's the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of that Text. Yong men, you are set upon the waies of your own hearts, according to Sence, and the sight of your Eyes, you see a great deal of Bravery and Gallantry in the world, and whereby you shall come to live jocund and merry lives, your minds are upon that, and you will walk according to the sight of your eyes: when you see other yong men brave, and merry, and jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cund, and gallant, O you think that's a brave life: well, go on, <hi>But</hi> remember that God will bring you to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for all this: It notes that their hearts are mightily set upon this, to do according to the sight of their Eyes, and according to what is sutable to their own spirits: And so you know the Apostle <hi>John</hi> calls Covetousness, <hi>The Sight of the Eyes;</hi> there's the Lusts of the Flesh, the Pride of Life, and the Sight of the Eyes: The world

                     <p>And then the things of Sence they are Present, they enjoy them now; but the things of Faith they must stay for they know not when, and to have them they cannot tell how; but for those of Sence they see they may have them at present, and they find them good unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: And upon this they walk according to Sight.</p>

                        <p>Shewing the great evil of walking by Sence. 1 It is beneath a rational Creature, who hath his Reason given him to correct Sense in Natural things; and in things that concern his everlasting Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness also, at least negatively, to shew him wherein his felicity doth not consist. 2 It is infinitely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the Spirit of Wisdom. 3 They who are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by Sence, are liable to continual temptations, because the Devil gets into the Rational Soul by the Sensitive first. 4 Men living by Sence, are besotted and without God in the world, very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely to come to good because the way of Gods bringing to eternal Life, is above Reason, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove and contrary to Sence; and they who never mind an higher end in the way of their lives shall perish.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>NOw this is a very great Evil, for men to have their hearts taken by what they see with their eyes, and by what their Sence tels them to be pleasant and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to them: Oh that I could but make you see the evil of this; abundance of good might come of it, for certainly it's this that is the undoing of thousand thousands of souls: This thing that I am here treating about, is the undoing almost of all the world, The walking by Sight and by Sence. Oh how many have been deluded this way, and at length they have come by their woful experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to see the evil of this! When they have been upon their sick bed, and death bed, what hath been that which
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:118704:104"/> they have cried out of most? Oh such things were so pleasant to Sence, and me thoughts they were so fine and brave to mine eyes, and I was carried by that, and now God shews them otherwise to me. Oh that we could but apprehend things now as one day we shall apprehend them: that man or woman hath received great mercie from God, that hath now the same apprehension of things as one day they shall have. There's a great evil in this, To go according to the Sight of our eyes.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 For this is beneath a Rational Creature; What hath God set Reason in Man for, but to correct their Sence, and especially in matters that do concern their chief good? I beseech you observe it, Reason is a great help to correct Sence in many things.</p>
                     <p>As you know in Natural things, Reason can correct Sence there: A Country man that is only carried by Sence, he thinks that the Sun is no bigger than his Cart Wheel, by Sence it appears no bigger: But those that understand the Principles of Astronomy, they can by Reason demonstrate as plainly as twice Two is Four, That the Sun is bigger than the whol Earth: Reason will correct Sence in Natural things; Reason certainly will help much to correct Sence in things that concern mans happiness, and mans everlasting Good, especially when it comes to be Sanctified: But Reason at least ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatively, will shew a man wherein his happiness doth not consist; it will tell us certainly, That the Happiness of one that hath an immortal soul, it's not the same happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness that a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>First, Thou wilt have Heathens to be witnesses against thee, that are acted by a higher way, By Reason.</p>

If ever thou beest sav'd, I say thou must be Acted and Guided by the Holy Spirit of God.</p>
                     <p>Further, Whosoever walks by Sight, they are liable to thousand thousands of Temptations continually; Oh the danger that they are in of temptations, what a snare do they walk upon! The Sences of men are the wide doors by which the Devil comes into their souls, he doth come into the Rational Soul by the Sensitive first, and if he gets into the Sence, and prevails there, he will get into Reason and prevail there: The Eyes, Oh what Casements are they to let in the Devil by; how many men and women (as the Scripture speaks) have <hi>eyes full of Adultery,</hi> that cannot cease from sin? Saith Christ, when thou lookest upon a woman to lust after her, thou hast committed Adultery in thy heart: Oh those Case<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments let in wonderful evils into the soul: What was that which let in the first temptation that ever was in the World?

                     <p>In the next place, If thou livest by Sence, thou art ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unlikely ever to come to good; for the way of God in bringing men to Eternal Life, is a way high above Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, as shall be shewed; but much more above Sence: It is not <hi>above</hi> only, but <hi>Contrary</hi> to Sence, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if thou beest a man that art given to thine Appetite, given to follow the sight of thine Eyes, given to Sence, it's very unlikely that thou should'st come to any thing that's good: And hence it is that those that are led by Sence, have very slight thoughts of the waies of God, and they are the great scorners and enemies of Religion, as we reade in <hi>Philip. 3. 18. For many walk</hi> (he speaks of those that walk by Sence) who are they? <hi>They are Enemies to the Cross of Christ, whose end is destruction, whose God is their Belly, and whose glory is their shame, who mind Earthly things:</hi> These are they that are ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the Cross of Christ; for Sence hinders Reason, much more hinders Grace: In <hi>Hosea,</hi> 4. there you read of those that liv'd according to Sence, at verse 11. <hi>Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Wine, and new Wine take away the heart:</hi> they are not capable of receiving Good while they live according to Sence: I will not enlarge my self to treat of a Sensual Life, but only touch it, to shew the evil of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving according to Sence.</p>
                     <p>It besots men extreamly; such men as live according to sence, they have extream miry and besotted spirits: we read of those Waters in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 47. the Waters of the Sanctuary, that they had power to heal, but in vers. 11. <hi>The miry places thereof, and the marishes thereof, shall not be healed, they shall be given to salt.</hi> The <hi>miry</hi>
                        <pb n="175" facs="tcp:118704:105"/> places: These may fitly resemble sensual men; they have miry hearts, they are like the Marishes that are not heal'd by the waters of the Sanctuary: The Word of God doth little good to sensual people.</p>
                     <p>Further, Those that live according to Sence, live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a God in the world, they give themselves up to lusts with greediness, and as for a God, and a Deity, they mind not him: They live as a Godless, Christless people.</p>
                     <p>And they shal die and perish, their end is destruction: And you know what the Apostle saith in <hi>Rom. 8. 13. He that lives after the flesh, shall die;</hi> that is, he shal pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish eternally. It's a most dreadful Text, and I admire that those men that are led according to sence in the course of their lives, how they can read that Scripture without horror of conscience, in verse 8. and 13. In the 8. <hi>So then, they that are in the flesh, cannot please God;</hi> it's cal'd flesh because that sin is acted so much by the sensitive part: and then in the 13. verse, <hi>If ye live after the flesh, ye shall die:</hi> Now to live after the flesh, it is to live after the Sensitive pleasures, that give content to the flesh, and those things that are sutable to the flesh: Now how do most men in the course of their lives act? nothing but flesh, and that which is sutable to flesh, that they bless themselves in: they have more to give content to the flesh than others have. As now, take some men that have a good estate, and live on their means; what's their lives better than others? the flesh indeed hath more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures than others, they have finer Houses, or sweeter Gardens, or softer Cloathes; and then the Appetite is more pleased, they have better Food, and can eat and drink more delicately than others, which they account their happiness: here's a man that lives by Sence, and this man is like to perish for ever. If you come to know no higher good, and you do not mind in the way of your lives any higher end than that which is according to sence, you are those that shall perish eternally. Indeed the Walk of Sence is very pleasant, but it's a dangerous
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:118704:106"/> Walk, and the end of it certainly wil be death: Oh that you would consider of this, and be humbled for walking according to the sight of your eyes: Oh look back to the vanity of your Youths; Yong people usually walk so: Oh look back, get alone and examine your hearts and lives: why Lord am not I toucht by this Word? did it not concern me? I find that men of the world they walk according to Sence, and that which is pleasant to sence; Oh Lord, it hath been my way for a great part of my life: and any of you that do thus walk to this day, Oh that the Lord would smight you, that you might come to see the evil of it, of walking according to the sight of your eyes: Your eyes wil be opened one day to see the evil of it, if they be not now.</p>
                     <p>And no mervail though the Word doth so little good to many people, the ground is because they walk accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the sight of their eyes, according to their sence: lay to thy heart that Scripture that was named in the 11. of <hi>Eccles.</hi> If thy heart he set according to the sight of thine eyes, God wil bring thee to Judgment: For all those pleasant things that hath delighted thy sences in the course of thy life, the Lord wil bring thee to Judgment: That man or woman that hath had the greater pleasure to sence, shal have the greater account to give the Lord; thou must give account of all thy sweet morsels, and of all thy stoollen waters one day, and therefore be careful now to give way no further to thy Sence than that thou maiest be able to give a comfortable account of, if thou wert call'd before the Lord the while this Book is in thy hand, and thou a reading of it.</p>

Now look to it, do not think it's a light matter, though perhaps you think, Oh God forbid that I should commit such an act of sin as the sight of mine eyes doth occasion, no, I hope I am far from that: but mark what <hi>Job</hi> saith, For what portion of God is there from above? and what inheritance of the Almighty from on high? As if he should say, Lord, if I did give liberty to this, I were in danger never to have any portion from thee, nor ever to have any inheritance from the most high. And what doth it give you so much content to wander after the sight of your eyes, as that you wil ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture your portion in the Almightie, and lose your inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance in the most High, never to have any good in him? this were a desperate thing, and yet truly so you do; those men and women that follow the sight of their eyes, I say, so they do; and if there were no other sin but this, this were enough for ever to deprive you of God, that you should never have any portion in him: Oh learn upon this Scripture to do as <hi>Job</hi> did then, to make a Covenant; no marvel though he made a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, for he speaks as if so be he should express himself thus, I indeed have been convinced divers times, That
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:118704:108"/> to follow the sight of mine eyes, is a dangerous evil, yet I sind my heart would be working that way until I was fain to come to a peremptory resolution, that I would not (the Lord assisting me) do so, and to make a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, for I see I am undone else: Oh that God would but cause this thought to stick in the heart of some man or woman, to conclude with themselves, Indeed, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess my conscience tels me, that my eyes have let in a great deal of evil to me, and I have thought that I would not take that liberty as formerly I have done; but now I see I am a lost soul for ever, except I be more careful of the sight of mine eyes: <hi>Job</hi> when he was in his greatest affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, one would have thought, if at any time his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science would have stir'd to have accused him for wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king after the sight of his eyes, it would have been now; no, but in his greatest afflictions, and when his friends did charge him of so great evils that he was guilty of because they did walk according to the sight of their eyes; no, but he could say, If my step hath turned out of the way, and mine heart walk after mine eyes, &amp;c. Oh that you could but say so, and that you would be now so careful of the sight of your eyes, that when you shall he upon your dying pillow, you may be able to appeal to God, Lord, thou knowest I have not▪ walked accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the sight of mine eyes: So that you see the Saints do not walk according to the sight of their eyes, nor ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Sence, no, they have mortified the flesh, and crucified the lusts of it; the work of Grace consists in mortifying the flesh, and beating down the body; and so <hi>David</hi> saith in <hi>Psal. 119. Lord, turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity:</hi> it's a very excellent Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and you should do well to take <hi>Davids</hi> Prayer, and this one Petition to God dayly, in vers. 31. <hi>Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity, and quicken thou me in thy way: David</hi> would fain walk with God; Oh Lord, when I am in the way walking with thee, I find this hinders me very much, Lord, my eyes will be
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:118704:108"/> wandering after vanity, and I am dull in thy way, but Lord, turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity; it is not said, Lord, keep me that my heart shall not be taken with vanitie; but Lord, turn away mine eyes from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding vanity: <hi>David</hi> was careful not so much as to look at vanitie; there's many have their Consciences so far convinc'd, Oh I wil not follow vanity, I but they do not make conscience of having their eyes turned away from vanitie: this holy man was necessitated to pray to God, and without Gods great help you wil not be able to do this, for the eye is a quick thing: O Lord turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity, and quicken me in thy way; as if he should say, O Lord, it's this that makes me so dull that I cannot walk with thee: you somtimes have wondered at your selves, what a dead heart have I in the waies of God, though God hath convinc'd me of the excellencie of them, and I have had some sence of the sweetness, and goodness of them heretofore, but O Lord what's the matter?

                     <p>And you know what a charge our Savior gives, <hi>If thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out:</hi> our Savior doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press the [right Eye] to shew that men may be carried many times by the eye to things that are evil, and it's ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry pleasing to the eye; but though it be thine eye that is set upon things never so dear; better be without thine
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:118704:109"/> eye than to suffer thine eye to run after that which is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, not that he should pluck out his bodily eye, that's not the meaning, but get out the corruption of the eye: And so far as to account it a better thing to be without the eye; it were better for many men and women, that they were blind than that they should give so much li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie to their eyes, to look after such vanities as indeed they do; Though Christ would not have us to lay vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent hands upon our selves, yet he so speaks that we should be very careful, though we get never such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent by it, and though it be very deer to us, yet to labor to pluck out the corruption of our eyes: A Godly man we see therefore walks not according to the sight of his Eyes.</p>
                     <p>As thus, Further, Though things seem to the eye to go never so cross yet a godly man doth not alter his way; as if <hi>Paul</hi> should say, I confess if we should walk accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to what we see in the world, we should never hold our course of Christianity, we see the Promises are not fulfill'd, but quite contrary: we see the waies of God as they appear to the eye to be quite contrary to what he hath said in the Word, we should be at amaze now if we should look according to what we see with our eyes; we see that the most precious Saints of God are persecuted, and hated, and if we should look at things according to the eye we should quite change our course; we see the wicked and ungodly prosper, and what now should we go according to the sight of our eyes? Oh no, let us see the wicked prosper never so much, and the Godly affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and persecuted, it's all one to us, we go on in our way. Oh it's this that keeps the hearts of the Saints close to God and to his waies, when they do not judg of things according to the eyes; and therefore if you would keep close, and deliver your selves from temptations, consider seriously from this; and blessed be he that can beleeve al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he sees not.</p>
                     <p>But many have not such power of Faith as to get be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:118704:109"/> the Eyes; surely that Faith that cannot get beyond Sence, is a poor and a weak Faith; there is not that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciousness in thy Faith, as the Scripture speaks of if it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not overcome the eyes.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore, We walk by Faith, and nor by Sence; we by our Sences do not apprehend those great things that take our hearts most; we cannot by our eyes see God, we may see some works of his indeed; we cannot see those Mantions that are prepared for us; we cannot see Jesus Christ our Savior, our Husband, our Head; we cannot see those Crowns of Glory: we do not walk by sight, that is, Because we cannot see those Spiritual things, therfore to be discouraged in our way; what though God, and Christ, and Heaven, and those Manti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Crowns of Glory be not objects of our eyes, yet we go on in our way for all this.</p>
                     <p>I, saith a Carnal heart, if we could see these things, you speak of Heaven, but can you see any thing beyond the Sun, Moon, and Stars? you speak of the place of the blessed, I but who ever saw it? and of Mansions and Crowns of Glory, but who ever saw them? Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they cannot be seen, therefore carnal hearts do not regard them: I but though our eyes cannot act upon Spiritual things, yet we go on in our way: You know the people of <hi>Israel</hi> came to <hi>Moses</hi> and said, Make us gods that may go before us; they would have somthing that they might see: Now saith he, we do not walk ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the sight of our eyes; though we cannot see God, yet we beleeve in him; though we canot see Christ, yet we love him; though we cannot see those Mantions, yet we beleeve them, and they are real to our Faith though we have not the sence of them: As now, God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="184" facs="tcp:118704:110"/> as <hi>Stephen</hi> can see Christ at the right hand of the Father, but at other times in regard of Spiritual Sence, we are in darkness, and God seems to appear against us as an enemy: now if we had nothing to walk by but by Sight, what should we do? We find that somtimes God seems to come against us, we find in our souls mightie griefs, and sorrows, and troubles, and the Joyes of God are gone from us; Oh now we were undone if we walked according to sence: Oh no, but we have help of our Faith, when al Sence and Sight fails. And I mention this now, because we shall ground much upon it when we come to shew how the Saints do walk by Faith; when they do want sence, not only outward sences to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage them, but the inward sence of the Love and favor of God, yet then they walk by Faith: It's true, the men of the world know not any thing but by the outward sences; when they are afflicted, and feel pain in their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, then they feel by sence that which is very grievous to them; but the Saints are afflicted in their sences with Spiritual things, that is, they feel the want of Gods Love, and of Mercy, and Sweetness; they feel the want of the presence of God, and yet we go on, we have not only help to our selves when the things to our bodies seems to go cross; It's true indeed that Godliness hath the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of this Life, and of that which is to come, but we find according to our sences otherwise; well, Faith wil help there, and we walk by Faith.</p>
                     <p>And then to the sence of our souls, in respect of the loss of Gods presence, that's more grievous, and the sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of our Spirits that comes that way; Oh the dark daies that we have when we lose al sight there, yet there comes in Faith and help too, for we walk by faith, and not by sight: As now, here I shall shew by divers exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples how the Saints have not walked by sight in respect of Spiritual things: Consider, <hi>Abraham,</hi> if he had wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked by sence, it had been ill with him; no, but it was by Faith: when God made these two great Promises to
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:118704:110"/>
                        <hi>Abraham,</hi> That he would give him the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and make his Seed as the Stars of Heaven: If after these two were made, he had walked by Sight or Sence, he had been in an ill case: For the first thing that we reade of <hi>Abraham</hi> after God had made that Promise to him; <hi>Abraham</hi> as soon as ever he went into the Land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi> was ready to starve and was forced to fly into the Land of <hi>Egypt</hi> to keep himself from starving, and yet this was the Land that should flow with Milk and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, as a motive to him to forsake his Fathers House and Kindred: I but <hi>Abraham</hi> had Faith to help him here. And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>o for the other Promise, that he would make his Seed as the Stars of Heaven; <hi>Abraham,</hi> after this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise was made to him, was twenty years, and had never a Child: now if he had walked by sight, what would have been become of him, both he and his wife being grown old? And after <hi>Isaac</hi> was born that was the only Son of the Promise, yet <hi>Isaac</hi> must be sacrificed: If he had had no other principle but Sence, what had become of him? he walked not by Sence. And so afterwards <hi>Isaac</hi> he was forty years before he marries, and was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie years without a Child. And so I might instance in <hi>David,</hi> he had the Promise of a Kingdom, and he was accounted to be the King of Israel: the next thing you read of <hi>David</hi> is, that <hi>Saul</hi> the King doth persecute him to take away his life, he was hunted up and down like a Partridg in the Wilderness; and at one time Sence began to prevail with <hi>David, One day I shall perish by the hand of</hi> Saul; <hi>And in my hast I did say that all men were lyars;</hi> that the Prophet and al were lyars; Oh but it was in his hast: Sence prevail'd now, and Faith seems to be dead: But at other times you shall see his Faith exceeding strong, he walks by Faith, and not by Sence. We shall shew more afterwards when we come to the excellencie of the walk of Faith: And so if you read <hi>Psal.</hi> 88. of <hi>Heman,</hi> which was a Godly man, yet he had that which was contrary to Sence all his daies; if
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:118704:111"/> he had walked according to sence, he had been the most miserable man that could be▪ he suffered the terrors of God from his youth up, and he was even di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>ed him on: And so I might hint to you divers Scriptures where the Church is afflicted, and tost up and down, so that if it should have gone according to sence, it would have been undone. Oh the very naming of these things unto you, wil shew the necessitie, and excellencie of the Point of walking by Faith, and not by Sence▪ now this the Lord would have his Servants do, because the more Spiritual Sence they have, the less Faith they have ordinarily, and Faith doth not appear in the acts of it when there is so much Spiritual Sence▪ we would fain have sence, and it is a lovely and excellent thing; but God sees that for the most part, when we have the most Sence, we have the less Faith, and so we are ready to rest upon our Sence: Observe this one thing, There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more in Gods design while we live here upon Earth than the advancing of his Glorie in the work of Faith▪ Though God hath his Glorie in the exercise of al Graces, yet above al in the exercise of Faith. We would fain give God Glory by our enlargements in prayer, and by our joy, and going on cheerfully in the course of our lives, and by prospering in our way, and carrying on all businesses before us: If alwaies the Church might pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per▪ and her enemies be down, and the Saints live joyful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and all things that they undertake, they might carry before them without any contradiction; you think Gods Glory would be set out that way; Oh you are childish and foolish to think so; no saith God, but rather let me hide my self, and the Saints be in want of my presence, then wil they act Faith, the naked acts of Faith wil then appear, Faith wil then appear in its own proper vertue: as i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ed by the work of Faith: And this I verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve is the cause of the sad conditions of the Saints in this world, and why things go so cross, and the Saints are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted, and the wicked prevail so in their designs, It is upon this ground, That God may advance Faith: From the infinite delight that God hath in the Grace of Faith rather than in o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="189" facs="tcp:118704:112"/> and the Saints are but weak, therefore God to help and strengthen them doth give them Sence: after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards when they come to riper years, and grow to better understanding in the waies of God, they shal not think to shoot up so high in so little a time; that is, so sensible as that others may perceive it. Thus the Lord doth supply according to our necessitie both in Nature and in Grace; and therefore let this be laid up: Oh you that have sence at any time, do not think that you must be alwaies so, do not think that God will alwaies dandle you as it were upon his knee: As at the first, you will dandle your Children upon your knee; but afterwards you will put them to school, and cause them to wait upon you at your Table, but not because you love them less afterwards than you did before, no, but because as they grow up they must live by other Principles; they live by Sence at first, and therefore you only please their sences; but as they grow up they come to have a harder kind of life▪ And so it is with Gods Children, though the Lord dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles them at first, and they live rather a life of Sence, though it be Spiritual Sence; but yet as they grow up more and more, they come to live harder and harder, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Lord would have them to exercise Faith.</p>
                     <p>Consider of this, and make use of it; you that are Christians find the need of it in the course of your lives.</p>
                     <p>The Principle that Saints have, is beyond the sight of Reason: And that we are likewise to speak to in the same manner as to the former.</p>
                     <p>First, Beyond the sight of Natural Reason.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Beyond Spiritual Reason. The Saints are so far from resting upon things that are sutable to Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Reason, and from being guided by that, as they are beyond even Spiritual, and that which is Sanctified Knowledg. Faith is beyond that.</p>

                        <p>Worldly men walk according to what they apprehend to be Reason, and that's their happiness; and 'tis good in the way of Justice between man and man, not in Gods Worship and Eternal Happiness. Five Expressions how they are acted by Reason in the course of their lives, and in Gods Worship.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>INdeed the men of the World, those that are in their Natural Estate; their walk is according to their eyes, according to what they apprehend to be Reason.</p>
                     <p>First, The happiness and highest good that they have, it is but that which in a way of Reason they apprehend, and no higher; and therefore but Natural.</p>
                     <p>And then their course and way is suted according to what principles of Reason they have: and if there be any thing propounded to them in the Walk with God that is not sutable to their Natural Reason that they do reject: A mans Natural Reason, if he be but guided by the Rules of it, may help him to converse with men very much in the waies of Justice between man and man: But when he comes to deal with God in matters of his Eternal Estate, and of Divine Worship, there let him look to himself that he be not acted by his Reason, for he will be undone if he be.</p>
                     <p>Therefore first I shall shew you how Carnal hearts are acted by Reason in the course of their lives, and especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the way of Gods Worship.</p>
                     <p>And Secondly, How this is not a good Rule to walk by.</p>
                     <pb n="191" facs="tcp:118704:113"/>
                     <p>And then thirdly, The danger that there is in wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king according to the Rules of mens Reasons. And so apply that.</p>
                     <p>And then come to treat about Sanctified Knowledg.</p>
                     <p>For the first, I find Five notable Expressions of carnal hearts to shew how they are acted by their own Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
                     <p>As first, <hi>They lean to their own Ʋnderstanding:</hi> In <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 5. there's a Caution, <hi>Lean not to thine own Ʋnderstanding;</hi> nothing that men naturally do lean to their own Understandings, it's that which doth support them and prop them up; let them come and hear from the Word, things that are against them, yet they lean to their own Understandings, and regard that rather than the Word; and in <hi>Hosea</hi> 13. speaking how they worshi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped God, in vers. 2. <hi>And now they sin more and more, and have made them molten Images of their silver, and Idols according to their own understanding:</hi> They had a way of Gods Worship set out unto them in the Word, but that would not serve them, but they must go accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their own understandings: Oh this hath been the way of carnal mens worshiping of God in all Ages; what kind of Worship and Service of God had we of late, but according to mens own Understandings? and therefore we used to say, Me thinks this is very good, and there's no hurt in such and such things, but they are very decent and comely; I but that's according to your own Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings: that should not be the way of Gods Worship, but according to the Word: Hereupon General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels and Synods have seldom been successful about the Matters of Gods Worship, because men came with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, leaning to their own Understandings. That's the first Phrase when men go according to their own Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings.</p>
                     <p>The Second is, <hi>According to the Imagination of their own hearts;</hi> and that you have in <hi>Jer.</hi> 9. 14. Oh they

                        <pb n="192" facs="tcp:118704:115"/> would walk according to the imagination of their own hearts, rather than according to what was revealed unto them by the Word.</p>
                     <p>The Third expression is, <hi>The walking according to their own Counsels:</hi> they would walk according to the Plots, and Imaginations, and Counsels of mens minds, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than to follow the Counsel of the Word; and that you have in <hi>Psal. 81. 12. They walked in their own Counsels;</hi> and indeed God in Judgment gave them up to their own Counsels.</p>
                     <p>The Fourth Phrase is, <hi>According to their own Thoughts:</hi> In <hi>Isa.</hi> 65. 2. it's a very remarkable Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The Reason of the wickedness of men, and why they did resist all the offers of Grace, and the Imitations of Christ was this, <hi>Because they did walk according to their own thoughts. I have spread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious people:</hi> God here complains, All the day long (saith he) I have spread out my hands; To whom? To a rebellious people: How came they to be so rebellious, and not to profit by Gods spreading out his hands? As a man when he is earnest about a thing, spreads out his hands to imbrace another; so God in the offers of Grace spreads out his hands readie to imbrace wretched sinners, but they are Rebels for al this: From whence comes al this? saith the Text in the next words, <hi>Which walketh in a way that was not good;</hi> what way was that? <hi>After their own thoughts:</hi> Oh lay up this Scripture and remember it; take heed of walking in a way after your own thoughts, you think it's a good way, but the way after your own thoughts, is an evil way, a rebellious way, it's that which makes you to be Rebels against God: How many men and women when they have some truths darted into their Spirits, that do begin to shew unto them that the way that they have walked in heretofore, hath not been good? Then they begin to think thus and thus, If I change this way, I shall have a deal of trouble in it, and I shal lose this and the other, and it will not be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:118704:115"/> to me, and so according to their own thoughts they wil order their way; Oh this is a dangerous walk to walk in a way according to our own thoughts: I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech thee poor soul take heed of your own thoughts, for there's nothing more dangerous to undo you than your own thoughts, and because they are so near to men, they let them in, and dandle their own thoughts, but those thoughts that thou pleasest thy self many times in, are the thoughts that are like to undo thee for ever: They walk according to their own thoughts.</p>
                     <p>The Fift Expression of Scripture is, That <hi>They are wise in their own eyes:</hi> and so you have it in <hi>Isa.</hi> 5. 21. and so in divers places in the <hi>Prov.</hi> This is to walk by Sight, to walk according to the apprehension of mens own Reason; but the Apostle did not, nor dar'd walk so: This is one main thing in the walking according to this sight and Reason; that is, such as are led according to what they see, working in a Natural way, by Natural Causes: A man that lives by the Candle light of Reason looks no further than Second Causes, if he sees Second Causes working thus and thus, then he will go that way, and follow the tract of Second Causes: Now certainly so long as thy soul is tied unto a tract of Second Causes, to work according to them, thou art not acquainted with the Spiritualness of the waies of God, nor with this walk of Faith: But reason is not that which should guide us in our way.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Reason is not that which should guide a Christian. 1 Reason not corrupted, is uncapable of the way of the Gospel. 2 Reason corrupted, is enmity with God, both in the Apprehensive and Discursive Part.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>FIrst, Reason is too low a thing to be the guide of a Christian. It is inferior to the Happiness that God made man for; God hath higher thoughts about man, to bring him to an higher Happiness than Reason can reach unto: The outward Sences are too low to guide a man that would live like a Rational Creature; outward Sence is not enough to guide men in a Civil way: So Reason is too low a thing for to guide men in a way that must lead to that supernatural Happiness that God hath made the Children of men for: Take Reason though not corrupted, right Reason, I do not speak of Reason as it is corrupted, but suppose mans Reason were not corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at all, but meerly were ordered according to what was right Reason, yet it was too low to bring thee to that glorious Estate that God made man for; yea, if thy Reason was as perfect as <hi>Adams</hi> was in Paradice, yet it would be too low; for the first man was of the Earth Earthly, and his Happiness was a kind of Earthly Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness; but that which God hath made man for now, it is a higher Happiness.</p>
                     <p>But it is too low, especially if we consider how it is corrupted: If our Reason had not received a blow, but was as perfect as <hi>Adams</hi> was in Innocencie, and did un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand God, and the mind of God as <hi>Adam</hi> did, yet this could not bring us to that Happiness that God hath made man for: The way of the Gospel is higher than
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:118704:116"/>
                        <hi>Adam</hi> did understand, or than his Reason was capable of.</p>
                     <p>But our Reason is corrupted; and the Scripture tells us of the <hi>Wisdom of the Flesh, that it is enmity with God:</hi> the <hi>Wisdom,</hi> the highest part of the Flesh, as in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. he doth not say only, that the wisdom of the flesh is an <hi>Enemy,</hi> but <hi>Enmity</hi> to God; and the carnal mind, or the wisdom of the flesh is enmity to God, for it is not subject to the Law of God, neither indeed can be: Mark the opposition, It is Enmity, for it is not subject to the Law of God, neither can be; Oh what an opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is here! And so you have another Scripture in the Epistle to the <hi>Colossians,</hi> where the Apostle speaks of the state of the Gentiles, and what they were before they were converted to God, and there he tels you, <hi>That we were enemies in our minds by wicked works:</hi> In your [<hi>Mind,</hi>] your very Reason was so corrupted as it was nothing but even enmity against God: the Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive, and Discursive part of Reason is opposite to God, and therefore in 1 <hi>John,</hi> 5. 20. it is said there, That <hi>God hath given us understanding, a mind to know him:</hi> The word signifies the Discoursive Faculty, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of the Mind, and Reason, whereby we may come to know the things of God. The very Discourses of men as they are Natural, they are corrupted, the Lord sees the Thoughts of the Wise to be but vain and corrupt, and therefore you know what our Savior said, <hi>I thank thee O Father, Lord of Heaven and Earth, that thou hast hid these things from the Wise and Prudent:</hi> and so saith the Apostle, <hi>Not many Wise, not many Rich, not many Mighty.</hi> And here I shal shew you,</p>
                     <p>First, The corrupt Principles that Reason carries men upon.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, How Reason is opposite and contrary to those main Spiritual Truths that should carry men on in the way to Life.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>Reason carrieth men upon corrupt Principles. As 1 It is not good to engage too far in any Cause. 2 It is the safest way to go according to the common streams of the times, and places where we live. 3 Not to venture present things for future, certain for uncertain. 4 It is not likely that a poor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible man, should understand more than the Learned. 5 To be Happy, and to be poor and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted, are inconsistent. 6 Good meanings, and performance of good Duties, are sufficient to make us accepted of God. 7 Zeal in some beyond others, must needs come from Hypocrisie.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>FIrst, How men that are guided by Reason, are carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on by corrupt Principles. As,</p>
                     <p n="1">1 First, That it is not good for a man to engage him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self too far in any Cause: Men that are wise for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and are carried on by the wisdom of the flesh, they are acted by this corrupt Principle, That it is not good to be engaged in any thing too far; there may be more danger in such a thing than I am aware of, and therefore let me go on fair and softly, and not engage my self too far. This is one Principle of corrupt Reason, and I ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily beleeve, that as I am naming of them, many may go along with me, and have cause to lay their hands upon their hearts, and say, the Lord be merciful to me, I have walked by sight, according to Reason, even these corrupt Principles that have in this Book been mentioned before me.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Secondly, It's not good to cross the stream and course of the tide where I live; it's the safest way for us
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:118704:117"/> to go according to the common stream of the times and places where we live; and this is that which the Apostle in <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. saith was the way of men while they were in their Natural Estate, <hi>In times past you walked;</hi> How? <hi>according to the course of the world;</hi> that was your walk: you saw the course of the world, how it was, and you thought in Reason it was fit to go according to the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent: That's the Principle that acts many Polititians that are accounted the wise men of the world, they are spirited b ythat Principle.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 A Third Principle of corrupt Reason is this, Not to venture Present things for Future, and Certain things for Uncertain: Men that are wise according to the flesh, they wil not venture things that are present, for things to come, especially looking upon things that are present as certain, and the other they imagine to be uncertain; and upon this Principle they are so acted and guided in their course that makes them put off the things of God, for the special and chief things of God, are things that are fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and by reason they can never be made certain: in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. it's said, <hi>Faith is the Evidence of things not seen:</hi> Now according to a principle of Reason it seems to be a foolish thing for men to venture a certain good for that which is to come, and for I know not what, and I know not when: This is against Reason, and it's that which makes the wise of the world to go on in their way, and to imbrace this present world: As it is said of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> It seems he was wise for himself, <hi>Paul</hi> told him of things for to come hereafter; but he forsakes him, and imbraces this present world.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 A Fourth corrupt Principle of Reason is this, That it's not like that a poor contemptible man should come to understand more than the learned Rabbies and Grandees of the world: Would Reason think that, that a few poor men that are contemned in the world, and whose parts of Nature are but very low in all Earthly things, yet that these should be the men that should come to understand
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:118704:118"/> the mind of God more than men that are Learned and wise in the Learning of the Egyptians, that had better Breeding and Education; this in Reason a man could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver imagine; and this is the great stumbling-block to the men of the world, They look, and see who are they that go on in such waies, not the Scribes and Pharisees, not the Rulers of the people, but the Multitude, and is this like to be the right way? Reason would tell one that 'tis not like to be the right way, Reason would inform one that the other way were more like to be the right way: Oh it would be a Mercy of God for men to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from this corrupt Principle of Reason.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 The Fifth is, That to be Happy, and to be Poor and Persecuted, are inconsistent: Carnal men they walk by their Sight, by their Reason, and for one to be Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, and yet to be poor and contemptible in the world, to be persecuted, and yet to be the happiest in the Earth, this is that which Reason cannot comprehend; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore according to that Principle they walk, they cannot beleeve that Happiness and Persecution, and Poverty, and Contempt, and Scorn, can consist together; this is a Rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, a Paradox: and yet you shal observe that when the Lord Christ that is the Wisdom of the Father, and knows fully the mind of the Father, when he comes to teach us wherein Blessedness consists, he begins with Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, and ends with Persecution; read but the 5. of <hi>Matthew,</hi> and see how he begins, <hi>Blessed are ye poor;</hi> and in the 6. of <hi>Luke</hi> he leaves out poor in spirit, and ends with this, <hi>Blessed are ye when ye are persecuted for Righteousness sake.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6 A Sixth Principle of corrupt Reason is this, That good meanings, and performance of good duties, are sufficient to make one acceptable to God: A man in Reason cannot imagine what people mean to take off men from Duties, and that their good meanings are not sufficient; they wonder that good hearts and meanings, that good works, and performance of holy duties, the
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:118704:118"/> living fairly and civilly, that the performance of these things should not make them acceptable to God, they cannot compass this; this is a corrupt Principle that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny go by.</p>
                     <p n="7">7 Another corrupt Principle of Reason is this, That the zeal and forwardness that there is in some beyond o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, must needs come from Hypocrisie: Men that are acted meerly by Reason, because they understand not those Spiritual Principles that Godly people are led by, they cannot judg in Reason what need there should be of so much forwardness and zeal that there is in some kind of men. The wise men of the World walk according to such Principles as these.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>Spiritual Truths are above the light of Natural Reason. As, 1 The necessity of a new Birth. 2 The more a wicked man prospers, the more cursed he is. 3 That God should work the worst things for the Saints good. 4 That the Promises are the greatest riches. 5 That all the world is vanity. 6 That we must be righteous by the righteousness of another. 7 That the Foundation of all Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is Self-denial. 8 That there is greater evil in the least sin, than in the greatest affliction.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THere are other things that are very much above the light of mens Natural Reasons. As,</p>
                     <p n="1">1 The necessity of a new Birth, of Regeneraeion, that a man must not only be better than he was, but that he must be born again: you know in <hi>John,</hi> 3. concerning
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:118704:119"/>
                        <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> that was a man of great Parts and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, a Ruler among the people; yet how childish was this man in the great Principle of Regeneration; saith he, must a man enter into his mothers womb and be born again? How can these things be?</p>
                     <p n="2">2 And then there's this thing that is mightily above mans Reason, That the more a man prospers, if he be wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, the more cursed he is: This Reason cannot appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, but is cross to it.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 And then, That God should work the worst things that do befal the Saints for good unto them; though it be never so cross and ill to them, yet that this should work for their good is a Principle beyond Reason, that they cannot understand: and men that walk according to Reason can never come to beleeve this.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 Besides, That the greatest Riches that any man can have in the world, they do consist in the Promises: these Principles are foolish things to such as walk by Reason: the Promises that are in the Word wil make a man richer than all the Gold and Silver in the world: A man that's meerly guided by Reason, laughs at these things, and thinks them but meer silly conceits of men.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 Next, That all the World is Vanity; that's a foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish thing to one that's guided by Reason; What! that all the Pomp and Glory of all the Monarchs on the Earth, that it's nothing but Vanity! Come and preach of such things, that our Riches are in the Promises, and all the World is but Vanity, and such a one as walks by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, slights and disregards all.</p>
                     <p n="6">6 Another Principle that he can have no skil in is this, That we must be Righteous by the Righteousness of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that nothing but a perfect Righteousness, and a Righteousness out of our selves there must be to present us as acceptable before God: This is beyond Reason.</p>
                     <p n="7">7 Another is this, That the Foundation of all Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness is Self-denial, and Mortification; that if a man would be happy, he must lay the foundation of his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:118704:119"/> in denying of himself, in denying his will, and his own thoughts, in the mortifying of the flesh, in the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing, especially that sin that he is most inclinable to; and there he may lay the very Ground-work of his Happiness: This Reason wil not attain unto.</p>
                     <p n="8">8 The last is this, That there is greater evil in the least sin than there is in the greatest affliction, as I have demonstrated out of that great Point that I have long<note place="margin">Vide, <hi>The Evil of Evils,</hi> or the <hi>Sinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of sin.</hi>
                        </note> since treated upon, That the Evil of the least Sin is greater than the Evil of the greatest Affliction whatsoever; That it is a greater evil for a man but to tell a lye, or to have an unclean thought, and to give way to it, than it is to suffer the loss of all his Estate, than to have all that he hath consum'd by fire or water, than to have any Evil that can be imagined to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal him: Now come and tel this to a man that hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Reason, that walks by the sight of his Eyes, these things are a matter rather of scorn and derision to him. And yet truly, though many that do thus walk according to these Principles, do not own them, and say that they walk thus; but God sees it that they are acted by such things as these are, and for such Principles as should carry them on in the way of Eternal Life, they are above them, and they do not apprehend them: I affirm God knows it, and your Consciences know it, and may tell you that you do not apprehend those Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples that are higher than Reason. But those that walk by Faith, walk by these Principles that are thus above Reason; therefore you know what the Scripture saith, <hi>That the Natural man perceives not the things of God, neither can he, for they are Spiritually discerned,</hi> 1 Cor.<note place="margin">

                     <argument>
                        <p>The Danger of mens walking by Reason. 1 The way of the Gospel is above Reason, Rhetorick, and Logick. 2 Reason is excellent, but if we walk according to it, it hardneth against God. 3 The Word works upon weak men sooner than wise, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they cannot fence off the Truth, as wise men with corrupt hearts. 4 It makes men slight in Spiritual Duties, without Communion. 5 They will not go through with a Duty, but start aside at every difficulty. 6 If God work Grace upon them, they will be fuller of doubts than others in whose understanding the Devil hath no forge.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>FIrst in this, That the way that God hath set for your eternal Life is a way above Reason; and it's a special design of God for to befool the Wisdom of the World, and to take the wise in their own craftiness; this is that God aims at: If you read the first Epistle to the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> Chap. 1. Verse 17. and so on, there saith the Apostle, <hi>Christ sent me not to Baptize, but to preach the Gospel; not with wisdom of words, lest the Cross of Christ should be made of none effect:</hi> It was Christs charge, that when I came to preach the Gospel, I should not go in that plausible way of Reason as others do, in a Rhetorical and Logical way, and to manifest Art so much; it's true, there's use to be made of Arts &amp; Sciences that may be understood by the light of Nature; yet the way of the Gospel must be that which is above them, and it must be delivered in a way above the way of Reason,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:118704:121"/> therefore saith he, I came not with wisdom of words, which yet <hi>Paul</hi> could have done as wel as another, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness his Artificial undoing of the Orators Speech, <hi>Act.</hi> 26. but he liked not to put the Sword of the Spirit into a vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet Scabbord that it could not pierce, to speak <hi>floride potius quam solide,</hi> as those self-seekers at <hi>Corinth</hi> did, that sought more to tickle the ear, than to affect the heart, to please, than to profit: But the Apostle purpose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly waved all gaudy, Court-like preaching, lest the Cross of Christ should be made of none effect; for the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Cross is to them that perish, foolishness; but unto them that are sav'd, it is the power of God: They see no wisdom in it; then in the 19. verse, <hi>For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the Wise, and bring to nothing the understanding of the Prudent.</hi> The way that God hath to bring men to Life, and to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, is to make them fools first in their own apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, to convince them of the corruption that there is in their understandings: And then in the 20. vers. <hi>Where is the wise</hi> (the Teacher of Traditions?) <hi>where is the Scribe</hi> (or Text-man?) <hi>where is the Disputer of this world</hi> (the Teacher of Allegories and Mysteries?) <hi>Hath not God made foolish the Wisdom of this world?</hi> and so he goes on: <hi>For after that, in the Wisdom of God</hi> (not by all their Natural Reason) <hi>it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that beleeve: For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumbling block, and unto the Greeks, foolishness: But unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the Power of God, and the Wisdom of God:</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Christ and the great things of the Gospel are foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to those that walk according to the sight of Reason: for saith he, <hi>The foolishness of God is wiser than men;</hi> he speaks here in the apprehension of the world, that is, the great things of God are accounted by the men of the world but foolishness, I but it's wiser than their wisdom,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:118704:121"/> and therefore <hi>you see your calling Brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny noble are called: But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world, to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things that are mighty; And base things of the world, and things which are despised hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not</hi> (that are nought set by) <hi>to bring to nought things that are.</hi> You may see by this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (read it at your leisure) how Gods design is to blast the wisdom of the World, and to befool al worldly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies; and he hath so set things in the way of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as those that will stick according to the rules of their own Reason, must perish and be undone eternally: they shall never come to know the things of God.</p>
                     <p>It's a dangerous thing further (yet Reason, take it considered without the corruption of it, is an excellent thing) but walking according to it, it turns that which is an excellent thing in its self to be a mischief to thee, to be a means to harden thee against God and his waies, and to be a means to put off the Truths: A man that hath strong Natural Parts, deep Reason, and yet a corrupt heart: Oh how can this man fence off the Truth of God when others cannot: And hence it is that many times the Word works upon those that are weaker in Natural Parts than upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, because when the Word of God comes to such a one, he hath nothing to fence off the Truth, whereas ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man that is subtil, and hath strong Natural Parts, he will have this and the other Objection against it; and surely this cannot be so, because of this reason▪ and the other reason; and so seems to baffle the Truths of God when indeed he doth but baffle his own soul; and so he ble<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>es himself that he hath baffled it, and fenc'd it off, when as it is but for his own ruine: And hence it is that when Christ came to preach, where do you hear of Christs converting any Scribes and Pharisees which were the learnedst men o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e opposite to the work of Conversion, and stand and wonder how God did over-power their Objecting hearts.</p>
                     <p>And by the way, you that have weak Natural Parts be not discouraged, for perhaps if you had had greater Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural parts, you might never have come to the understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Spiritual things as now you have: You reade in Scripture of the women that followed Christ and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles; And when as <hi>Paul</hi> was sent to preach at <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia,</hi> and he had a vision in the night, saying, <hi>Come over▪ to</hi> Macedonia <hi>and help us:</hi> we find that there were but few women that came to hear <hi>Paul,</hi> and amongst the rest God opened the heart of one <hi>Lydia</hi> a seller of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Men of strong natural parts, they fence off the Truths, and keepeth then at arms end; but men of wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker parts have received them: And now this will be the glory of God to al eternity when you come to Heaven, that God should chuse you to reveal himself to, rather than the great ones of the world; and therefore be not discouraged for the weakness of your Natural parts: There's a great deal of danger in walking according to the sight of mens Knowledg and Reason.</p>
                     <p>Again, Ther's this further evil in it, That it makes men very slight in Spiritual Duties: Men that have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Reason, they will perform Duties, but there's
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:118704:122"/> no life nor vigor at all, no warmth of their hearts, no communion with God in them; I appeal to your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, many of you that have gone but meerly in a fair Rational way before the world, though you do pray, and come to the Word, yet I appeal to you, What Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God have you? Those that walk according to Sight and Reason, are far from enjoyment of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God, their hearts are very slight and dead in things that are Spiritual and Heavenly; all their Services that they perform are meer Natural, and therefore in a very low and mean way that they do them: you shall have those that are far beneath them in Natural Parts, when they come to pray, Oh there's a Spiritualness and Heavenliness in their Prayers; you shall have many poor people of very weak parts sending up groans and sighs in Prayer; but come to some that are Schollers, and they will have fine quaint Prayers, and set Phrases, but no warmth at al, no heat, no spiritualness at all that there is in them, because they go according to Reason, and act no higher but meerly the Principles of Reason.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, Those that go according to the Principles of Reason, may make an onset upon some work that God sets them about, but a thousand to one but they will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver go through it; if there come any difficulty in the way they will quickly be carried off: there is no way to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severe in Godliness, but by being principled meerly by a Principle of Faith; if you be principled meerly by a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Reason, you will never go through a Duty, but you wil faulter in it when you meet with any difficulty, or start aside like a broken Bow.</p>
                     <p>Again, There is this evil in it, That if ever God work Grace upon any, they will be fuller of doubts, and fears, and perplexities than others are, ordinarily it is so; there is this evil in the remainer of corrupt Reason, and I have seen it by the examples that I have known of many men of excellent parts, they being converted have had more doubts about the Mysteries of Religion, more troubled
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:118704:123"/> with thoughts of Atheism, more perplexed in many things, and more followed with fears about their own Estates, they having been so addicted unto Reason, there doth remain so much strength of it, after their Conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as their Reason doth puzzle them extreamly: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as you have many of the meaner sort of people when God works Sanctifying Grace in their hearts, they never have any such doubts and fears, they look at nothing but in the morning to commit their souls to God, and read the Word; and when they meet with a Promise, their souls close with it, and blesse God for it, and so go about their business with comfort and joy, and never call any thing so into Question; the Devil hath not a forge in their understandings fit for his turn: but certainly a mans understanding that is of a large Capacity and not perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sanctified, the Devil can make a great use of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanctified part of it to forge a great many questions and doubts that wil puzzle and perplex the soul: So far as thou walkest according to Reason, so far thou wilt be brought into perplexity, and therefore there is a great deal of danger in walking according to the sight of thine eyes.</p>

                        <p>If it be so evil to walk according to the sight of mens Understandings, Then surely it's a vain thing to walk as they walk, and to make their walk to be the rule of thy walk: Oh no, we must not walk according to our own Reason, much less according to the Reason of other men; that's a double folly: It's a folly and danger to walk ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the dictates of our own Reason; of other mens, that's a very great madness.

                        <p>It's an Use of special Direction to those that God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins at first to work the work of Conversion, unto yong Converts. I beseech you consider of this one thing, and lay up this, and if God would but settle this one thing home, it may recompence you for what difficulties you come through to wait at Wisdoms gate; that is, When God is beginning to make himself known to you, and to shew you the things of Jesus Christ, and your Eternal E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state; take heed of poring too much by the eye of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and judging of things according to Reason; it will keep you off from Christ if you do so: If you would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed have the Word go on graciously and comfortably in your hearts, you must lay the naked Word and your hearts together, and do not puzzle your selves by Reason, I cannot understand how this and this thing should be thus and thus: As now, a poor soul when God begins to work, the Devil casts in this Temptation, and Reason helps to strengthen it, That such a poor wretch as I, so vile, so wicked, yet that God should have regard to me, I that can do nothing; there are others that are of great Parts, and yet that God should reject them that are able to do great things, repeat Sermons, and have great Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories, and yet that God should reject them, and have regard to me; what Service can I do for God? surely it wil never come to good. I, Reason will tel you so, in a way of Reason you cannot see how this should be: but
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:118704:124"/> when you have to do in matters that concerns your souls, you must remember not to be acted by the eye of your Understanding, it is dangerous. I remember <hi>Luther</hi> hath such a Speech, <hi>Reason is the most cruel Enemy to Faith that can be:</hi> And in another place, saith he, <hi>In the matters of God we must not be asking why so, and what's the Reason of every thing:</hi> If we walk according to Reason in the great things of Godliness and Eternal Life, we shall hinder our selves exceedingly; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let all yong Converts in the matters that concern their Souls and Eternal Estates, not hearken too much to what Reason saith: and though Reason say it cannot be, yet know, if the Word saith otherwise, I must go according to the Word. I know not how it should be, I cannot see how such a wretched heart as mine should ever be brought to any good at all, and how God should take delight and Pleasure in me, and how I should come to have commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God, I cannot see how ever I should come to this. Well, though you cannot see it, look at the Word, and rather shut the eye of Reason than follow the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates of Reason: we must not walk by sight, nor walk by the Eye of Reason.</p>

                        <p>Further, It should have been to rebuke those that come not up so high as Reason: There be many that walk in such a base and wicked course that Reason would convince them to the contrary, and God will bring their Reason against them one day: The Gentiles that had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the sight of Reason, would have scorn'd such waies as many walk in, they did abominate those waies of yours. Then how far are you from the walk of the Saints, and walking with God, that come not to so high a walk as the very Heathens walk; they walk'd up more to the Rules of Right Reason than thou doest.</p>

                        <p>The next thing is, That a Saint should be so far from ordering their waies according to Reason, as their very Sanctified Knowledg is not sufficient; though they come to have the Spirit of God to Sanctifie their Reason, yet they must have a Ptinciple beyond this. I mean by this, That Sanctified Knowledg is not sufficient: There are many things, and the great and necessary things of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life, which are things that are to be apprehended by a Principle beyond Knowledg, which is Faith, that we cannot by Knowledg come to apprehend: As thus; The Mystery of the Trinity, of the Personal Union of both Natures in Christ, how these Bodies of ours should come to be more glorious than the Sun in the Firmament: it's impossible that we should come by Knowledg to have these things made real to us in this world; no, it must be by Faith: that's thus, The Evidence that we have of them, it is not because we come to understand these things, how these things should be by any Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, but meerly because we beleeve what God hath aid, for that's the difference between taking thing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Saints expect greater Glory than they understand: The Ground of Faith is Divine Revelation, and this is different from Knowledg, though Sanctified, which must be done away, when we shall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand not by way of Reason as now, but by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate presence of God.</p>

                     <p>ONly this now for the working upon your hearts by it, there's this useful and fruitful Note.</p>
                     <p>That certainly there are greater things that the Saints by Faith are taught to expect, and that by faith are made evident to them, greater things than ever they knew or could reach to by any Spiritual Understanding: we can by our Spiritual Understanding come to know that there is a great good in communion and enjoyment of God; but Faith makes good to us a greater good than we can know; we have some Notions about God and Heaven; but Faith is higher than all our Knowledg, therefore the Saints may expect greater happiness and glory in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven than ever they understood. The weakest Christian that hath his understanding elevated by Spiritual Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, is able to understand such things as the strongest man in the world that is ripest in his Natural Parts can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

And this is the excellency of a Christian; when he can walk thus, he can walk on high. This is to walk with God indeed.</p>
                     <p>Grace doth raise Reason higher than it was, and doth take away much corruption from Reason; but yet the Principle of the Saints in their walks is beyond their Sanctified Reason: that's thus, The main thing that dot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> guide and carry on the Saints in their way is that which is beyond what can be known by Reason in this world, elevated to the greatest height, as for instance, The Principal things of Christian Religion that the good of the Saints consists in, cannot be known by Reason, though elevated by Grace, it must be in a way of Faith and Beleeving: As one God in three Persons, we beleeve it, but we cannot know it that there is One in Three, Father, Son, and holy Spirit, Reason can never reach to this, no, though <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t be Sanctified. That the way of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is by a Mediator, God and Man, this is beyond

                        </gap>un in the Firmament; the way of our Communion with God and Christ in Heaven, for God to be all in all; one cannot apprehend this by Reason, but it must be by a Principle of Faith: Let our Knowledg be raised by grace to the height, we can never come to know the causes of such things as these are: but the ground of our Faith is meerly Divine Revelation; now to receive a thing upon Divine Revelation, is different from the receiving of it in a way of Knowledg; the Scripture is cleer in this, and for it take these two or three Texts:</p>
                     <p>The first is in 1 <hi>Cor. 2. 9. But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor Ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prrpared for them that love him:</hi> Eye hath not seen, Ear hath not heard, neither hath it entred into the heart of Man, no not into the hearts of the Saints by any way of Knowledg; <hi>But God hath revealed them to us by his Spirit,</hi> it is by Revelation: There's a great deal of difference between having things by way of Knowledg, and Revelation: When I have things in a way of Knowledg, I come to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand them upon such Principles as are written in mans Nature, or when I know that the whole is greater than any part, I do not say that I beleeve it, but I know it; but that which I come to beleeve, it's that which we have no evidence of by any way of Reason, but only by Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: There may be many Reasons given in a way of helping and strengthening us to beleeve the Scripture, and many things in Religion; but that which is the ground and bottom of all, must be a Rvelation by the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, for Reason can never reach to those things that are the very Principles of Faith, they are beyond Reason: such things as eye hath not seen, nor Ear hath heard, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath entred into the heart of man.</p>
                     <p>And that place in 2 <hi>Cor. 4. 18. While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:118704:127"/> not seen;</hi> they are not seen by us, neither by Sence, nor any kind of Reason, though never so elevated by Grace; they are not seen, but beleeved.</p>
                     <p>And so that in 1 <hi>John,</hi> 3. 2. saith he, <hi>Beloved, we are now the Sons of God, we are sanctified by the Spirit of God; but it doth not yet appear what we shall be:</hi> we cannot understand by Reason, not by any kind of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Reason what we shall be; <hi>But we know, that when he shall appear, we shall be like him, for then we shall see him as he is.</hi> We do not now see God in any way of Reason so as we shall then, only we beleeve great things about God, but we are not able to behold him; therefore in 1 <hi>Pet. 1. 8. Whom having not seen, ye love, in whom, though now you see him not, yet beleeving:</hi> You see how <hi>Beleeving</hi> is opposed to <hi>Seeing</hi> of God: therefore it's said of <hi>Moses,</hi> He saw him that was invisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; he was invisible in a way of Reason, but he was seen in a way of Faith: Faith doth rise higher than San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified Reason. We have some kind of knowledg of some Spiritual things; but this knowledg that we have must be done away, therefore certainly there are things that we beleeve, that are beyond our knowledg, beyond the knowledg of the Saints; for the Apostle in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 8. speaks of the knowledg of the Saints there, and saith, <hi>Love never faileth: but whether there be Prophesies, they shall fail; whether there be Tongues, they shal cease; whether there be Knowledg, it shall vanish away.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It's a very strange Expression, <hi>Whether there be Knowledg, it shall vanish away:</hi> What our Knowledg vanish away! Shall not the Saints have Knowledg in Heaven? Surely their Knowledg, you wil say, should be encreased in Heaven: But the Text saith here, that Knowledg shall vanish away; that is, the things that we shall come to see in Heaven, they are things that are so high and great, that are beyond the coming to understand in that way of Reason as now we understand things in this world. We come to have Knowledg, How? By
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:118704:128"/> the Sences; for so the Phylosopher saith, Nothing goes into the Understanding, but first comes into the Sence: We come to have Knowledg from without, and we come to work from what is presented from without us; but this same kind of Knowledg shall be done away, we shal then only be swallowed up in God himself, in the Beatifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Vision of the most High; we shall see as we are seen: Certainly <hi>we are seen,</hi> that is, God knows us not in the way as we know things in this world, and we shall know God as he knows us, we shall have our Understandings inlightened with an immediate presence of God shining upon the Understanding, and the Understanding even swallowed up in God himself, so that Knowledg shall be done away: So then, there are things it seems in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven that are beyond our Knowledg, for when we come to enjoy those things, our very knowledg shall be done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. I remember that Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> upon this Scripture saith, That all the Natural Excellencies of men here in this world, the excellent Parts and Gifts they have in the knowledg of Arts and Sciences, shall be done away; and therefore those that have weak Natural Parts, may have as cleer a sight and vision of God as the greatest and most learned men in the world: Our Natural abilities that we have here, wil not be any way helpful to us to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of God when we come to Heaven; but the poor weak people that are of low Understandings, so that they scarce understand any thing in a way of common Reason, yet they shall have as much Knowledg of God, and as cleer an Inlight into the Nature of that pure Being of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and into the glorious things of God, as the greatest Rabby that ever was upon the face of the Earth, for Knowledg shall be done away. There are therefore things that are beyond Sence, beyond our Reason that is elevated to the greatest height here in this world: and we walk by Faith. This might be of great comfort to those that have weak Parts here in this world; though their Parts be weak, yet that will not hinder them in the
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:118704:128"/> receiving of the glorious things of Heaven.</p>
                     <p>But I shall leave that about walking by Sight, and come to treat about that which is the Principal Truth in the Text: <hi>For we walk by Faith, and not by Sight.</hi>

                     <p>First, I shall shew, <hi>What the Walk of Faith is;</hi>
                        <pb n="220" facs="tcp:118704:129"/> when a Saint may be said to walk by Faith.</p>

                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>The Excellency of it.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Sixtly, <hi>Choice Rules that we are to observe in the want of our Sight and Sence, yea, how we should exercise Faith in the want of all.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Lastly, <hi>How Faith carries the soul through all kind of difficulties in this world; when Sight fails, yet Faith carries through.</hi> These are the Principal Heads in this Treatise.</p>
                     <p>First, What it is to walk by Faith; briefly, and more Generally thus:</p>
                     <p>Then doth a Soul walk by Faith, when the soul walks on in the way that God would have it, when Sence and Reason is at a stand, by what Faith brings to it: Many times a Christian in his course finds all things that appear to Sence and Reason to fail him, and the soul is at a loss in respect of those things, but yet Faith comes and helps at a dead lift: when Sence and Reason knows not how to go any further, Faith brings in that which carries on the soul in the way that God would have it: This is to walk by Faith.</p>
                     <p>But more Particularly thus:</p>
                     <p>To describe the Walk of a Saint by his Faith.</p>
                     <p>First, The Scope and End of the way of a Saint is presented unto him by Faith; for in a walk, a man looks at some End: Now the End and Scope of a Christians Walk, to what he walks, is Two-fold.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Either the enjoyment of Communion with God.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Or the Glorifying of God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> But you will say, <hi>Why is it only Faith that doth present this, the Glorifying of God, and the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Communion with him? we may know by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:118704:129"/> that we were made for God, and we are to glorifie God in our way in the course of our lives, Reason would tell us this: and that the chiefest good of a Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Creature is in Communion with God, Reason hints to us this; why do you say then that Faith presents this to the soul? though there be no Faith, yet a man by Reason may be convinc'd he ought to glorifie God, and that his Happiness is in Communion with him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> To that I answer this, That indeed Reason will tell us these two things, but in a lower and darker way than Faith doth, and the happiness of man in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of these two things is but Natural so far as Reason carries it: Reason tells me I am to glorifie God, let me glorifie God no otherwise than Reason tels me, it's but in a Natural way: And Reason saith that my happiness is in the enjoyment of God, but if I enjoy God never any otherwise than Reason presents God to me, I can have but a Natural Happiness. But Faith goes further in presenting this Scope and End of my life: Faith tells me that I am to glorifie God in the way of the Covenant of Grace, I am to glorifie God in and by Jesus Christ, his Son; I am in the whol course of my life to lift up the Glory of God as it is revealed in the Gospel, God in Christ: and truly till we come to know this Glory that God would have from his Creature, namely the glorify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him in his Son, in the way that he hath propounded himself, we never give him any Glory that he accepts of. He may so far accept of it, as he may bless us with some outward temporal Blessings in this world, but never ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of it to Eternal Life; A man that hath never such strength of Reason, and sees he must not live as a Beast, but he must acknowledg and worship God that is the Infinite Supream Being of all things, he may come to know this in the light of Reason; but if he rises no high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, it's but in a Natural way, and God accepts not of that: But now when the soul comes to know God in Jesus Christ, and comes to understand the brightness of the
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:118704:130"/> glory of God as it shines in the face of Christ, and so comes to honor him in the way of the Gospel: this is the Scope of a Christians walk: And this is to walk by Faith. And when men only in a Rational way look at God as the last End, and so as the highest good, this is but meer Natural: But when I look upon God in Christ as my happiness in him, when I look upon God as communicating himself to his Creature through his Son, look upon the interest that my soul hath in him through Jesus Christ.</p>
                     <p>Her's the Scope of my life if I be a true Christian, the working of my heart, and all the actions of my life tend this way: you never knew what it was to walk by Faith, except you had the Scope of your life presented to you by Faith, shewing you what it is to glorifie God in his Son, and enjoy Communion with God in him. And that's the first thing in the Walk of Faith.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The soul in walking by Faith is guided by the Rule that Faith doth present unto it: As it hath the Scope and Aim that Faith doth present to it, so the Rule that doth guide it is only presented to the soul by Faith, only by Faith: I confess Reason will go far, will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent unto men many Rules for the guiding of them in the course of their lives; such and such a way is sutable to right Reason, and such a way is against Reason, and thus far your fair Civil worldly men go; they see what is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Rule of right Reason, and so they are gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: But Faith presents a better Rule, the Rule of the New Creature, <hi>Those that walk according to this Rule,</hi> (that the Apostle speaks of in <hi>Gal. 6. 16.) peace shall be on them, and the whol Israel of God:</hi> This Rule is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Rule of the New Creature, <hi>For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision, but a new Creature;</hi> and saith he, as many as walk according to this Rule, peace be on them, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and upon the Israel of God: Faith shews to my soul
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:118704:130"/> what the Rule of my way is: the Rule of the new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as it is revealed in the Gospel, those Gospel Rules which I find in the Word that only are made known to me by Revelation and Faith: Whatsoever Revelation it be that the soul doth receive, it is enabled to receive it by Faith: And so, if it be but meerly a History, then we cal it an Historical Faith; or if a Miracle, then a Miraculous Faith; or if it be the Revelation about the Grace of God in his Son to my soul, then it comes to be justifying Faith: But the Nature of Faith in general is that Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue or Grace whereby the soul receives readily and freely the Revelation of the mind of God in the Gospel where God sets out the way of bringing men to Eternal Life by Jesus Christ: Now Faith, it is the receiving of these Truths of God thus revealed, and those men that stick so upon it, that they will receive nothing but what they can have Reason for, they will fall short in the day of Jesus Christ, they will fall short of that Rule that will guide men to Eternal Life. And that's the Second thing, when the soul is guided by such a Rule as Faith only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents unto it.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The Walk of Faith is, When the way of a Soul is likewise by Faith; that is, the way of Holiness, it is a way that is by Faith.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Quest.</hi> You will say, <hi>What do you mean by, The way of Holiness, it is the way that is by Faith?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> By that I mean this, That whereby the soul comes to be separated in its actions, in the course of it, from al filthiness and uncleanness, it's Faith purifies the heart, it's nothing but this: then the soul walks by Faith, when by receiving those Divine Principles that are revealed in the Word it comes to be enabled to sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate it's self for God from all uncleanness, and to separate the actions of it from the filth and uncleanness of the world, from those mixtures of filth that the actions of other men are mingled withal; then doth a soul walk by
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:118704:131"/> Faith when there is that Power in its beleevings: Thou sayest thou doest beleeve such and such Truths that are revealed in the Word, but what power hath thy Faith to clense thee? That's the way of Faith when it hath that power in it to separate thee from mixtures and base uncleannesses in the workings of thy heart and in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of thy life.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, When Faith brings in strength unto the soul to enable it to go on in its way: The strength that a soul gets is by Faith, the closing of the soul with Jesus Christ, and by Faith drawing vertue from Jesus Christ, as the poor woman in the Gospel found vertue to come from Christ: so when a Christian finds want of strength to the performance of any action that God requires, what doth he now? it may be some will resolve I wil do thus and thus, and leave my sin, and set upon a better Course, and they go forth in the strength of their own Resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and perhaps they do somwhat, and reform their lives a little more than formerly they did: I but this is not the walk by Faith; but a Christian that walks by Faith, when he comes to see what God requires of him, and withal finds his own inability, he then goes and acts his Faith upon Jesus Christ, and the Covenant of Grace, and the Promises, and there draws strength to enable him to the performance of what God requires of him.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, A Christian walks by Faith, when Fairh brings in, not only power to do that which is required, but when there is any opposition; Faith enables to resist opposition, to resist whatsoever is in the way to hinder the Walk: As there's either opposition from without, Persecution, when men oppose such a way, and set them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves against it. Now when a Christian acting of Faith can be carried on, Though I be weak otherwise, yet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>hrough Faith in Christ I can go through opposition, and whatsoever I suffer for Christ, yet still through that
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:118704:131"/> which Christ hath revealed to me in the Gospel. Or if not outward, yet there may be inward oppositions, the fiery Darts of the Devil; you know the Scripture saith, That Faith is a <hi>Shield</hi> that quenches the fiery darts of the Devil; not only that keeps them▪ off, but quenches them; this is a strange kind of Shield: A Shield, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when Darts, and Bows, and Arrows, was of great use: Here the Devil shoots fiery Arrows; as somtimes in War, they have such a device that they will shoot out of Cannons, Bullets red hot; so the Devil he shoots fiery Arrows: But this Shield doth not only resist them, but quenches the fiery Darts of the Devil. And so Faith is an <hi>Anehor</hi> in the midst of storms and tempests to keep the soul from suffering of Ship-wrack; and not only helps against opposition, but lifts it up above discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements, and carries it through all difficulties: I put these three together; When by what Faith brings in, the soul is enabled to go through oppositions; Raised above Discouragements; And carried through difficulties; then is a Christian said to walk.</p>
                     <p>Sixtly, Then doth a Christian walk by Faith, when his great care is to go on in his Duty, but for what shall become of him, for the success, he can commit al to God: Here's a Christian walking by Faith, when he so orders his life, as nothing troubles him in this world what should become of him, how he should be provided for, what success he should have; but let me be where the Lord would have me, and do what he would have me, and commit all my waies and success unto God alone.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, A Christian when he can satisfie his soul by what he receives by Faith as really and truly as any other men can satisfie themselves in the enjoyment of any good: Look what satisfaction to their spirits other men have in the enioyment of what they desire, that satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction a Christian that walks by Faith hath, in the belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:118704:132"/> what is promised; he can find as satisfaction in the beleeving what is promised, as other men can find in the enjoyment of what they have for the present: Oh this is the walk of a Christian in his way. A man that is not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with this Grace of Faith, is eager in the desiring of such and such things, and if he cannot have his desire satisfied, he is never quiet; nothing wil calm him but the satisfaction of his desire: I but, now a Christian can look into the Promise, and if he sees but the good thing promised, he is as wel satisfied in the Promise, as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is in the enjoyment of his desire; and indeed ther's a great deal more satisfaction in the receiving of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, than there is in what all the Creatures in the world can afford for the satisfaction of our desires; If God should give us the enjoyment of all Creatures in the world, they cannot so satisfie the desires of the soul, as a Promise can satisfie the desires of a Beleever; and this indeed is a great mystery in this walk by Faith: But this is the way of a Christian, and those that understand what the walk of Faith is, know what I mean: But unto carnal hearts they seem to be riddles, and they think them Aery Conceits and Notions; but such as know what it is to walk by Faith, know otherwise: Let but a word of Promise be given out, it's enough for a soul that walks by Faith: And because this is a great Point, I'le given you a Text or two to shew what satisfaction a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise is to a beleeving soul that walks by Faith.</p>
                     <p>The first Scripture is in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20. you find that <hi>Jehoshaphat</hi> had been praying to God in the time of a great danger, and having been praying, he received an answer of his prayer in the 17. verse, <hi>Ye shall not need to sight in this battel, stand still, move not, and hehold the Lord towards you, &amp;c.</hi> here he receives the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise: Mark then in the 19. verse, <hi>And the Levites of the children of the Kohathites, and of the Children of the Korhites stood up to praise the Lord God of Israel with a loud voyce on high:</hi> They fell a praising present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:118704:132"/> they had not got the Victory; and in the 20. verse, there's an Exhortation to beleeve, <hi>Put your trust in the Lord your God, and ye shall be assured; beleeve his Prophets, and ye shall prosper:</hi> and in the 21. verse, <hi>When he had consulted with the people, he appointed sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers unto the Lord, and that should praise the beauty of Holiness as they went out before the Army; and to say, praise the Lord, for his mercy endureth for ever:</hi> Was <hi>Jehoshaphat</hi> out of his danger that he set singers to praise the Lord, for his mercy endured for ever? No, he was in as great a danger as before, only he had a Promise, and having a Promise, he thinks of nothing but praising of God, for his mercy endures for ever: A Carnal heart would have said, stay, let us first see what the success wil be, and then we wil sing praise; nay saith he, I have a Promise, and I am satisfied as much in that, as another man would be satisfied in the Victory.</p>
                     <p>Another Scripture which is very famous for this, and that is in the 108. <hi>Psalm,</hi> 7. verse, <hi>God hath spoken in his Holiness: God hath spoken;</hi> the word is, <hi>Come out:</hi> What then? <hi>I will rejoyce;</hi> presently, he doth not stay for the fulfilling of the Word; I have the Word, and I know he is holy in all his Work; <hi>I will rejoyce, I will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide</hi> Sechem, <hi>and meet out the valley of</hi> Succoth; Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lead <hi>is mine,</hi> Manasseth <hi>is mine,</hi> Ephraim <hi>also is the strength of mine head;</hi> Judah <hi>is my Law-giver;</hi> Moab <hi>is my washpot; over▪</hi> Edom <hi>will I cast out my shoo: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> Philistia <hi>will I triumph:</hi> And all this because God had spoken, the thing was not done; but the Prophet was as much satisfied in the Word, as in the thing being done. This is to walk by Faith; When the soul can be satisfied in a Promise as much as others are in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of what they have.</p>
                     <p>Eighthly, When the Soul can depend upon God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone for all, in the want of all means; when all means shall fail, and if it would consult with Flesh and Blood,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:118704:133"/> with Means, with Second Causes, it sees its self undone; but in the failing of all these means, yet the soul can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon God, and yet conclude, <hi>It shall be:</hi> As you know that was the Commendations of <hi>Abraham</hi> when his Body was even dead, yet contrary to Hope he could beleeve; let become of means what will, yet it is God that hath promised, and I can depend upon God in the want of all means.</p>
                     <p>Ninthly, The Progress that the Soul makes in the waies of Godliness, is by Faith; the walk of a Saint is from Faith to Faith, from one degree to another; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as Faith encreases, so there's a Progress made in the waies of Godliness; when a soul doth not stand at a stay, he is not the same that is was seven yeers ago, but is got higher and higher, and neerer to God, and all by Faith, Faith doth act the soul still higher and higher to God in a constant way and course: That Progress that a Saint makes is by Faith.</p>
                     <p>Tenthly, The Constancy of enduring in a Christian Course, it is likewise by Faith; as it's said of <hi>Moses, he endured;</hi> as seeing him that is invisible, that was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible to Sence or Reason; but by Faith he did endure: whatsoever hinderances he had in his way, yet he kept on his way to the end, and so received the end of his Faith, even the Salvation of his Soul.</p>
                     <p>Eleventhly, Yet one more there is, and that's a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral; When a Saint doth in his whol Course walk as it beseems one that doth beleeve such glorious things as he doth, when he holds forth in his life, the glory and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of those things that he professes he doth beleeve; for Christians they do profess their beleeving of very great things; The beleeving in God and Christ, and the speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al interest that their souls have in God; the beleeving in the Covenant of Grace; the beleeving of the things of
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:118704:133"/> the Kingdom of Heaven, of their everlasting enjoyment of God there: these are great things: He may be said then to walk by Faith, when in his life and Conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on there is a sutableness, and an agreement to all these great things that he professes he doth beleeve: You Christians, when you speak of such great things that you say you do beleeve, even such things that the Angels de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to pry into, do you hold forth this in your lives? This is the walk of Faith, when the walk of your lives is sutable to what you profess you do beleeve: Oh then put all these together, and then may a Christian be said to walk by Faith:</p>
                     <p>When the Scope of his Life, and End of it, is presented by Faith.</p>
                     <p>When the Rule of his Life is by Faith.</p>
                     <p>When the way of his life, the separation from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanness and filthiness, is by Faith.</p>
                     <p>When the strength that he hath to walk, is by Faith.</p>
                     <p>When the power to resist opposition; To be raised above Discouragements; and to go through difficulties, are by Faith.</p>
                     <p>When he can take care for nothing but only to be where God would have him, and do what God requires of him, and leaves all to God.</p>
                     <p>When he can be satisfied in the Promise as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers can be in the enjoyment.</p>
                     <p>And when in the want of all means, yet he can depend upon God.</p>
                     <p>When his Progress and going on, is through Faith; from Faith to Faith.</p>
                     <p>When his Constancy and Enduring to the end, is by Faith.</p>
                     <p>And when in his whol Conversation he holds forth the glory of his Faith, and lives sutable to those great and glorious things that he professes he doth beleeve: Here is one that walks by Faith in his Course, here indeed is the life of a Saint on Earth: And whereas the Scripture
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:118704:134"/> saith, the Just lives by Faith; the holy Spirit seems to take a great delight in the Phrase, for it's very often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated in Scripture: And thus the Just lives and walks by Faith. That's the first thing.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>The Saints in all Ages have walked by Faith. 1 Enoch. 2 Noah. 3 Abraham. 4 Jacob. 5 All the Patriarks. 6 David. 7 Jonah. 8 Church, though they had less means, and a less glorious object than we have.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>I Might shew you the Examples of the Saints at all times, how they have made their walk a walk of Faith.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 As <hi>Enoch</hi>'s walking with God was by Faith; that is apparent in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. he pleased God; and if you read the Epistle of <hi>Jude,</hi> there you shall see the walk of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noch</hi> with God, <hi>And</hi> Enoch <hi>also, the seventh from</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, <hi>prophesied of these, saying, Behold, the Lord co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth with ten thousands of his Saints: Enoch</hi> that was the seventh from <hi>Adam,</hi> yet he beleeved the coming of the Lord with ten thousands of his Saints though it were almost six thousand yeers ago, yet <hi>Enochs</hi> Faith rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to it: <hi>Enoch</hi> when he saw ungodly men, and heard them speak hard speeches against the waies of God, loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked beyond all their prosperity, and as is he should say, it may be they prosper in this world, and they speak hard speeches; Oh the hard speeches that many ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:118704:134"/> men belch out against the waies of God: though they prospered a while, yet <hi>Enoch</hi> could look beyond all their prosperity, and by his Faith was able to see the coming of Jesus Christ when he shall come with ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of his Saints in all his glory at the great day, and the sight of this made <hi>Enoch</hi> walk on in his way; as if he should say, let others do what they will, and please themselves in their ungodly waies, and walk according to the Flesh; I dare not walk as they walk, for why? Oh I beleeve the Coming of Christ in all his Glory, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noch: Enoch</hi> that lived almost six tbousand yeers ago, yet he by Faith could behold the coming of Christ, and by that work of his Faith was he kept on in his walking with God; let men do as they please, yet he would keep on constantly in his way, and this Text shews what it was that kept him on in his way.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 And so <hi>Noah,</hi> he walked with God in his Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, surely it was by Faith too; that place in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. shews plainly that it was by Faith; <hi>By Faith</hi> Noah <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing warned of God of things not seen:</hi> Mark, he did not walk by sight, but being warned of God of things not seen as yet; <hi>moved with fear, prepared an Ark for the saving of his house, &amp;c.</hi> all was by Faith; and indeed that which he did, it could not be by any other Principle but by Faith.</p>
                     <p>For first, That he was so Godly in his Generation; you read in <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. that the whol world had corrupted their waies, <hi>And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the Earth, and that the very imagination and thoughts of his heart was only evil continually:</hi> this was the corruption of the times wherin <hi>Noah</hi> lived; what kept <hi>Noah</hi> upright all this time, when mens wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness was so great, and God was resolved to destroy men from off the face of the Earth; but saith he, <hi>Noah found grace in the Eyes of the Lord, and</hi> Noah <hi>was a just man, and perfect in his Generation, and</hi> Noah <hi>wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with God;</hi> surely it was by Faith: What could it
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:118704:135"/> be but a Principle of Faith that should make <hi>Noah</hi> fall upon building of an Ark one hundred and twenty yeers before? God tells <hi>Noah</hi> that there should be a Flood come upon the Earth, and therefore bids him build him an Ark: An Ark! we never read of any such vessel to swim in the Water: <hi>Noah</hi> might have had a thousand Reasonings; What should I that am upon dry Land, and well, must I go and build a Vessel that must carry me in the Water? and I build, what I alone, am I wiser than all besides? they will come and mock, and what new kind of fine thing is this that you are a building? To what purpose should I go to build an Ark? I am no Marriner, and I know not how to mannage it: I but I must build it; and by Faith he went on in his way.</p>
                     <p>And then suppose that a Flood should come and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the whol Earth, is it a likely thing that the Water should come up upon the top of high hills? Yet <hi>Noah</hi> beleeved this.</p>
                     <p>And then, All my Neighbors that are about me, may kill me if they please, and put me out of the Ark, and take it themselves: Sence and Reason would tell him so; and yet <hi>Noah</hi> went on in his way.</p>
                     <p>Well, But suppose God do put me into the Ark, and keep other men that they should not take it from me, but that I should have the benefit of it: I but then God tells me that there must be in it all manner of Creatures, two and two to come into the Ark, all venemous Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and wild and savage Creatures, they may destroy me? I but <hi>Noah</hi> beleeved this, that God would preserve him.</p>
                     <p>Again, I must have an Ark in which may be all sorts of Creatures, and food for all these, what Vessel would be able to hold this: But yet <hi>Noah</hi> beleeved God.</p>
                     <p>I but when they are there, surely the very filth that would come from those Creatures, would poyson me: yet <hi>Noah</hi> still beleeved.</p>
                     <p>And when I am in the Ark, and all the World shall be
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:118704:135"/> covered over with Water, what shall become of me at last? yet he beleeved that God would provide for him.</p>
                     <p>God put <hi>Noahs</hi> Faith to it, and by Faith he went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Ark, and was preserved there: It was the walk of Faith that was <hi>Noahs</hi> walk in his Generation.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 I might likewise shew you the walk of the Saints in other times; As of <hi>Abraham,</hi> how when he first came from his Fathers house, what a walk he took to walk into the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and then afterwards into <hi>Egypt,</hi> up and down from place to place, and had not any possession at all but of a burying place, and was in the midst of dangers and oppositions from time to time, and how God tried him in the main thing that he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed him. Oh the walk of <hi>Abraham</hi> by Faith, was very famous.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 And then the walk of <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Faith.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>And yet take this one Note, they had not the means of Faith as we have, they had not the object of Faith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to them so gloriously as we have: Oh when we read the 11. chapter of the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> it should make us ashamed for, and troubled in the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of our Unbelief: Oh the glorious work of Faith that was in those Primitive Saints.</p>
                     <p>The work of Precious Faith in them appeared very gloriously; therefore it should occasion such a Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as this:</p>
                     <p>Oh! Should they that lived in the time of the old Testament, or before the New, yet should they thus walk by Faith? Oh how much more then should we that live in the time of the new Testament! Had they had but the four Evangelists to read over, of Christs being come in the flesh, and the manner of his coming, being born and living; and the Sermons of Christ, had they them but to have read over, and the Stories of his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles in the <hi>Acts,</hi> and the great mysteries of Grace that are revealed in the Epistles that we have; Oh what Faith do you think would there have been in them then! Read but the old Testament, and how little have you there of Jesus Christ, of the Covenant of Grace, and of the things of Eternal Life; no, the Apostle saith, that Glory and Immortality were brought to light by his Gospel; it was little known in the time of the Law, and yet the glim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merings that they had of those Objects of Faith, did strengthen them, and carried them through difficulties and oppositions whereby they were enabled to walk by
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:118704:136"/> Faith: And so it is recorded of them for their Honor e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the end of the World; They received a good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port by their walking by Faith, to be an Example to us; Oh that we that are Christians, and profess our belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in such glorious things as we do, we should be ashamed that we are led so much by Sence and Reason as we are: Oh let us labor above all things to manifest the Glory of Faith, for 'tis this that God especially aims at: 'tis the great design that God hath to lead his people a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long in such a way as may magnifie this grace of Faith: and therefore those of you do most honor God in the world that do most walk by Faith; not those men and women that have most comforts, they do not most honor God; those men and women that have most honors in the world, and most encouragements in the waies of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, these are not them that do bring most honor to God; but those that do walk most by Faith: when the Lord looks from Heaven, and sees a poor Creature that wants Sence, and hath not those encouragements that others have, and it may be thou art not used in such excellent service that others are, and thou thinkest thus; Oh the Lord hath little use of me, I am not imployed in such things as others are imployed in, I do little Service for God in my Generation: I but doest thou exercise Faith in thy afflicted condition, in thy low condition, in that condition of thine where thou seemest as though God did but little regard thee, canst thou beleeve and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise Faith in such a condition? know that this is accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table before the Lord, and thou by the exercise of faith in thy low condition, mayest bring more honor to God than many that have excellent parts and gifts, and are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in glorious Service for God: But of that we shal have occasion to speak more further when we come to that head of shewing the excellency of Walking by Faith.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>The necessity of walking by Faith: 1 Because the waies of God are mean and vile to Sence and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. 2 That there may be an agreement between us and God. 3 Because many things that are the Rule of our lives, depend meerly upon the will of God revealed without Reason. 4 That we may see the Authority of the Rule, and make it come with power to our hearts. 5 That we may see the reallity of Spiritual things. 6 That we may see through the colors and vain shews that are put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the waies of Sin. 7 Because the waies of God do somtimes seem contrary to his Word. 8 Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of oppositions, outward and inward. 9 Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause by it only we please God. 10 Because the End of the Saints Walking, is above Reason. 11 Because the efficacy of all means we use for any good, depends upon Faith.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>IN a Saints walking with God, his walk by Faith hath a Principal share. I have shewed what it was to walk by Faith. And then, that it was the walk of the Saints: this is finished. I shal proceed unto the necessity of this walking by Faith, and the Excellency of it: If a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian doth not walk by Faith, he will certainly miscarry in his way.</p>
                     <p>First, The absolute Necessity that there is of it: If we wil profess our selves real Saints, and walk with God, we must have a great use of the Grace of Faith in all our waies.</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <pb n="237" facs="tcp:118704:137"/>1 The necessity of walking by Faith is this, Because that the waies of God have a great deal of outward mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in them, and appears to be vile to Sence &amp; to natural Reason; even the great things of the Gospel, they are foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishness to a carnal heart. I remember <hi>Tacitus</hi> that was a great Scholler, speaks of the way of the Jews (which were the only people of God) the Way and Customs that God taught them, <hi>That it is absurd, and a sordid Way;</hi> and yet no people upon Earth had the mind of God revealed to them, but they in their time: and <hi>Josephus</hi> tells of one that speaking of the Jews, saith, They are hateful to men, and more foolish than the very Barbarian: These thoughts have carnal hearts of the Waies of God; they are very mean and vile, therefore there is need of Faith to shew us the way that we should walk in.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 There is a necessity of Faith, That there may be an Agreement between us and God, <hi>Can two walk together and not be agreed?</hi> How can there be an Agreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and our souls but by Faith? <hi>Rom. 5. 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing justified by Faith we have peace with God;</hi> our peace with God doth not come from any obedience to the Commandement, but by Faith; it is not the reforming thy life, though that must be, for it's a sign thou art not at peace with God if thou doest not reform thy life; but all these do not make up thy peace, that which makes up thy peace with God is thy Faith in Christ; yea, and when a Beleever hath made peace with God, yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he may do that which shal break his peace, the sence and the comfort of it, yea, and so far break as there may be a fatherly displeasure against him; now it must be faith that must it up, 'tis not enough to think thus, I have done that which hath broke my peace with God, The comfort of it to my soul, I will amend, and reform, that's good, but that's not the thing that thou must rest on: I but I will renew my Faith, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise that upon Christ, and so make up my breach: <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming</hi> that will <hi>follow upon it;</hi> but the main thing
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:118704:138"/> that makes the Agreement, it's the work of Faith, and therefore Faith is absolutely necessary.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Faith is of absolute necessity to walk by, Because that many things that are to be the Rule of our lives, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend meerly upon the will of God as it is revealed in the Word without any Reason given for it: I confess there are many things of the mind of God that we may see a Reason for, yea, there are some Principles in mans Nature, that are not wholly done away by the fall, that will shew to him that such and such things are Rules for him to walk by: but there are others that are meerly by the will of God without any Reason at all, and therefore there is a necessity of Faith for the discovering of them unto us.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 There is a necessity of Faith, That we might come to see the Authority of the Rule by which God would have us to walk: though we may by Reason see som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, yet there is a Divine Lustre and Authority in the Rule that we cannot come to know but by beleeving: in the 119. <hi>Psalm,</hi> 66. verse, saith <hi>David</hi> there, <hi>Teach me good Judgment and Knowledg; for I have beleeved thy Commandements:</hi> Here you see the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God are an object of Faith, as well as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, which many do not think of; they think their Faith is only to act upon the Promises, I but Faith is to act upon the Commandements: That which is received by beleeving, is received in another way than that which is received by Reason; as if he should say, I see some Reason in thy Commandements, I but there is a Divine Authority, and lustre and glory in thy Commandements which is beyond that which is to be revealed by Reason, and that I receive by Faith: I by Faith have come to see and apply that infinite Mercie, and Glory, and Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that there is in thy Commandements: Oh that we could but learn this, to beleeve the Commandements as well as to understand the Commandements, or to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced by Reason of them, that we are not to Lye, nor
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:118704:138"/> Swear, nor prophane the Sabbath, nor commit Adulto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, nor do any act of Injustice; these things we may convince mens Consciences of: I but yet they do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve the Commandements, that is, the infinite dreadful Authority that there is in them, for this, Reason doth not bring with power to the soul: Oh those that God works Faith in, they come to see, and to apply another kind of Authority in the Rule than they have done here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore: therefore there is a necessity of Faith in our wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, even to make the Commands of God to come with power to our hearts.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 There's a necessity of Faith that we might come to see the Reallity of Spiritual things; they are all but No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to us until we come to have the use of the Grace of Faith in the course of our lives; we may talk of Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and Sanctification, and Adoption, and Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, and of the Love of God shedding abroad, and of the Spirit of God, and being guided by Gods Spirit, and the Priviledges of the Saints, and such things; we indeed speak of these things, but they are but meer Fancies and Notions to us till we come to have Faith, and Faith gives a real Being; according to that in <hi>Heb. 11. Faith is the substance of things hoped for,</hi> it gives a substance to them, and makes them to appear the most real things in the World, therefore there is a necessity of Faith for the making of Spiritual things to be Reallities to the soul.</p>
                     <p n="6">6 There's a necessity of Faith in our walking, That we may be able to see through the colors and vain shews and pretences that are upon the waies of Sin, we shall be gul'd and deceived else by the color, and pretences, and fair shews that are put upon these, those guildings that are upon the waies of Sin; Sin will appear very fair and spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious: the most dangerous and desperate waies of Sin, wil present themselves seemingly desirable to us, except we have a piercing eye of Faith to look beyond present things: Faith is necessary in our walk that we may see
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:118704:139"/> through those paintings and daubings that are put upon the waies of sin, that we may look beyond things that are present, it's said of carnal hearts, that they do not see afar off, 2 <hi>Pet. 1. 8. If these things be in you, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound, they make you that you shall neither be barren, nor unfruitful in the knowledg of our Lord Jesus Christ: but he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off:</hi> He can see only things that are present; but you that have the knowledg of Christ, can see afar off. Oh there's a great necessity of Faith in the course of our lives.</p>
                     <p n="7">7 A great necessity of Faith there is in our walk in the course of our lives, because that God doth seem in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>is way to go often so contrary to what he speaks in his Word, therefore I shewed you that Sence and Reason is not enough,: But now I am to shew you the necessity of Faith, because that God in his waies will appear to go so contrary to his Word that we shal not be able to see them: To that I have shewed you, that God in his Works doth somtimes seem to go contrary to his Word, As in <hi>Ahraham:</hi> I'le give you some other Instances; As his bringing of his people Israel to the Land of Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an; he promised to them a Land that should flow with Milk and Honey: they were brought into the Southern part of the Land at first, that for the greater part was the most barren, only some little might be fruitful; but it was of all the Land the dryest part, and the most fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less; and this is the reason o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> that Expression that we have in the 126. <hi>Psalm,</hi> 4. saith the Psalmist there, <hi>Turn again our Captivity O Lord, as the streams in the South;</hi> the streams that were in the South were mighty refreshing and comfortable; there were streams in other parts of the Land as well as there; but they were most comfortable, because that the Southern part of the Land was so dry and barren, and therefore any streams in the South were very refreshing unto the people; and thence is this Phrase, Turn again our Captivity as the streams
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:118704:139"/> in the South: God brings his people into the barrennest place at first; what was this for, but to try their Faith? It seemed to be contrary to what God said of the Land, that it should flow with Milk and Honey: And so if you read the 20. of <hi>Judges,</hi> 28. 31. compared, God made a Promise of Victory to the People, and yet you shall find, that though he promised them Victory, at first there was a slaughter made, and such a slaughter as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged the enemy to hope for a victory over them again the second time: After God makes the largest and fullest Promises of mercy to his people it's his usual way to seem to go quite contrary: Oh the waies of God are unsearchable and his judgments are past finding out: If there be not Faith, we shall presently be offended when we see that the Works of God seem to go contrary to that word that we have thought we have beleeved in.</p>
                     <p n="8">8 A necessity there is too in respect of the strong op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions that the Saints meet withal in their way; they meet with the Devil, and World, and Flesh, and all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing them in their way, the oppositions from the world by waies of scorn, and contempt, and persecution, and it may be opposition from their kindred, from their Parents, from their Governors, from their neerest yoke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellow, bosom friend; if there be not Faith to help a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst al these, the soul would never endure; <hi>Moses</hi> endured by seeing him that is invisible. So in inward op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, from temptations within, from the strong cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions that are within the soul, except Faith comes in the soul wil soon fade away: there's a notable Scripture that we have in the 64. of <hi>Isa.</hi> 6, 7. mark there the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of the Church in the time of their affliction and trouble, <hi>All we</hi> (saith the Prophet in the name of the Church) <hi>do fade as a leaf, and our iniquities like the wind, have taken us away:</hi> Oh their hearts were down and discouraged; but what's the Reason of this? <hi>And there is none that calleth upon thy Name, that stirreth
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:118704:140"/> up himself to take hold on thee;</hi> This was the Reason why they faded away like a leaf: when a leaf wants moisture, and hath the Sun to dry it, it soon fades away: so it was with them, they met with trouble and opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, inward and outward, so that like a leaf they did fade away; but it was upon this ground, Because none stir'd up himself to take hold on God, because they did not act Faith upon him: In the time of their sufferings when they were in a low and afflicted condition, when temptations and troubles came, then they should have stir'd up themselves to have taken hold on God; had they but had the use and exercise of Faith then, they should not have had cause to have made such complaints, and therefore a necessity there is of Faith for the overco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of strong oppositions; Set Reason, or Experience many times against oppositions that a Christian meets withal in his way, and they are but as Paper walls to keep Bullets off: But now Faith can set even Christ himself, and the Promises of the Covenant of Grace; and these are as a Brazen wall against oppositions; it's faith that doth quench the fiery darts of the Devil. A man hath strong temptations, and there comes in the fiery darts of the Devil thick upon him: Now he begins to Reason with himself; here's these temptations, and why should I yield to them? if I yield, I shall bring shame to my self: Alas, this is but as a paper wall in comparison; and if I yield to such temptations, I shall bring a great deal of trouble and affliction to my self, and my consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence wil not let me alone, but fly in my face: these are some things to help against a temptation, but they are al but as paper walls in comparison of the actings of faith upon God and Jesus Christ: If the soul could but stir up it's self to take hold upon God in Jesus Christ, this would strengthen it far more, and be as a Brazen wall in comparison of the other.</p>
                     <p n="9">9 And then another thing that shews the necessity of Faith, and that's a special thing to be considered of,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:118704:140"/> We must walk by Faith, all our walk else wil be to lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle purpose, Because it's by Faith that we come to please God, and without that it's impossible to please him; in <hi>Heb. 11. 6. Without Faith it's impossible to please God:</hi> Whatsoever thou doest in the way of God, yet if there be not the exercise of Faith in it, it is not accepted: Thou thinkest thou walkest with God in this Duty and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, thou prayest continually, and hearest the Word, and receivest Sacraments, and conversest with the Saints, and doest such and such good actions; these are wel, but except Faith comes in and mingles, there's none of them please God: It may be, before thou wert acquainted with the way of the Gospel, thou wert very careful in thy course; thou did'st keep thy constant times in Prayer, and didest attend upon the Word, and didest live very wel among thy Neighbors, and read the Scriptures much, and wert careful to come to Christ's Appointments; but if thou wert not in the walk of Faith all this while (though it's better to do this than to neglect it) yet if thou beest not in the walk of Faith, these things are not pleasing to God; they are indeed not so displeasing as the neglect of them would be, and therefore they ought to be done even by unbeleevers, for materially they are good, and better to do that which materially is good, than not to do it at al; I but, if you speak of pleasing God in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der unto Eternal Life, and in the Complacensie that God takes in such things as he is pleased with his Saints, they do not please him so, no, it's the work of Faith in the very action that must make it acceptable to God; if you tender it up to God, it must be by faith: Oh how neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary is Faith then to make every thing pleasing to God, and therefore consider of this Note: It's not enough that you are Beleevers in general; that is, that you have saith in Christ, and so you have pardon of sin, but this shews there is a necessity of putting forth faith in every action.</p>
                     <p n="10">10 Further, The Happiness of a Christian is that which is Supernatural, the last end that a Christian hath,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:118704:141"/> is supernatural; therefore as I shewed you when I ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned what it is to walk by faith, Faith brings in the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the end of our walk, and here it shews the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of it: If our end in all our actions be above Reason, then we have need still of the use of faith in every thing that we do, that we may alwaies have the right end: And it is that indeed that doth commend an action in Morals, it's the end that makes the good of an action: And so in Divinity, it's not what the Action is, but what the End is; this crowns all: The necessity of faith is in this to carry on al our actions to a Supernatural End, to an End beyond Reason.</p>
                     <p n="11">11 Lastly, It's Faith that is so necessary, Because the efficacie of al means that we use for any good, depends upon Faith: God sets us about the use of means for the attaining such ends, God never ordain'd means that they should help us to attain such ends by vertue in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; but God ordain'd means to convey himself through those means, and the effic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>cy of them must be by using them in a beleeving way; such and such means God hath appointed for such ends; but if I make use of those means and think that they have any vertue or effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy for the attaining those ends, I frustrate the good of the means; but if I would use them in a profitable way, I must mix faith with them: I use these means, but it's the love, and goodness, and mercy of God that I trust in, in the use of these means. If I use the means to preserve my Natural life, I should exercise Faith there: <hi>Asa</hi> is blamed for using the means of the Physitian, and trusting to him, and not unto the Lord; but then much more when I use means for my soul, I come to the Word, and Prayer, and other Ordinances; there's no efficacy at all in al these any further than faith is mixed; you know what the Apostle saith, The Word did not profit them because it was not mixed with Faith; and so in Prayer, the Prayer of Faith will save the sick, but if you trust and rely upon your prayers, you will spoil al; the thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:118704:141"/> must be done, but that wil not do it, and you will find your Prayers wil come to little; and that's the very Reason why the times of prayer in your Closets, and in Publick have come to so little; you have prayed against such and such corruptions, but when a temptation hath come, you have been overcome as before: you wonder at it, and think, Lord, what shall become of me? I have prayed against this sin I know not how many times, and I thought that thou hadst come in sweetly to my soul, at such a time, I had such enlargements, and I went out in the strength of my Prayer, and thought that verily I should be able to overcome my sin, but I find I am as weak as ever: It's because thou didst trust in the means, it's true, God appoints such and such means, I but he appoints faith to convey his grace through the means; thou didst pray, and wert earnest with God, I but didst thou beleeve in thy prayer, and act thy faith upon Christ and the Promise, and the Covenant of Grace in Prayer? Oh Faith, it's that which is necessary in the use of all means to make one to have profit and benefit in them, and therefore certainly Christians must look to that especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to walk by their Faith.</p>
                     <p>And thus you see the Necessity of it.</p>

                        <p>Walking by Faith is Excellent: 1 Because it hath higher apprehensions of God than others have. 2 It makes Civil and Natural actions, Heavenly. 3 It brings delight unto the soul. 4 It makes us converse much with God in all things we do. 5 By it we most honor God. 6 The soul is freed from fears by it. 7 It makes us do great things for God. 8 It makes a great progress in the waies of God. 9 It causeth uprightness in the heart. 10 We have Salvation present. 11 It is useful in all conditions. 12 It brings a good report from God himself. 13 It makes us die comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.</p>

                     <head type="sub">The Excellency of Faith.</head>
                     <p>THat walk that is by Faith, hath a great Excellency in it, many waies.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. First Excellency thus, Because a Saint that walks by faith hath higher apprehensions of God, and the work of God than others have: the apprehensions that others have of God, are very low and mean in comparison of one that walks by faith: One that walks by faith, can see God upon his high Throne; others see but the back parts of God, but one that walks by faith, beholds his Glory with open face: when <hi>Moses</hi> would see the Glory of God, in <hi>Exod.</hi> 23. latter end, God said that he should see his back parts; but the Gospel saith, that with open
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:118704:142"/> face we behold his Glory; we do not only see the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps of God, but see him in his face, see him in his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Excellency upon his Throne on high: and that's a most excellent thing.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 That Soul that walks by faith, carries on all actions in a high and Supernatural way, makes his very Civil and Natural actions, to become Heavenly and Supernatural; it doth ennoble every work, and puts a price upon every thing that a man doth. I remember <hi>Luther</hi> hath an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression concerning poor Milk-maids that are Beleevers, and walk in their Callings in obedience to God, and as a fruit of their faith, they are more glorious actions when they go up and down with their milk-pails, than al the Victories and Triumphs of <hi>Alexander,</hi> and <hi>Julius Caesar,</hi> and all upon the Earth; Why? Because they walk by faith; And the Scripture is very famous for this concerning <hi>Joseph,</hi> in the 11. to the <hi>Heb.</hi> What was the Act of <hi>Joseph</hi> that he did, it was the carrying of the bones of his father into the Land of Promise: when his father <hi>Jacob</hi> died, he would be buried in the Land of Promise, and <hi>Joseph</hi> carries the bones of his father thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that's made an act of Faith; a very low and mean action one would think to go and bury his fathets Bones in such a Ground, yet that's made a glorious A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and recorded by the holy Spirit as a most excellent Action, Why? Because it was the action of Faith: So the meanest work of your Callings, if it be but done by faith, it's an excellent action, and honorable before the Lord. Now you that are in very low Callings, Servants that are but making clean the house, and doing the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest works, yet still if it be as a fruit and effect of your faith, and your acting faith in the action, you make it a supernatural and a glorious action that God highly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steems of: Many poor people that are imployed in mean things are discouraged; they think that others that are imployed in the great affairs of the State and Churches that they are happy people; but your faith will make
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:118704:143"/> your lowest and meanest actions more glorious than theirs.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 The Excellencie of walking by faith is this; Faith brings in whatsoever good there is in Christ, in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, in the Promi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>es, and makes it sweet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the soul, and now for one to walk up and down in the whol course of his life, and not only to suck in the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness that there is to be had from these in his first conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but every day to be sucking in the sweetness of the Promises, and to enjoy whatsoever is in Christ and the Covenant of Grace, it must needs be an excellent and a glorious life, and this is the life and the walk of faith: Oh it is a most delightful walk then, the walk by faith; and so far as we exercise faith, so far we bring delights into our souls; if there be any delight and good to be had, either in Christ, and the Covenant, and the Promises, it is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed when we walk by faith: Surely then we need not walk droopingly, and heavily, and sadly like <hi>Bennonies,</hi> if we had but hearts to exercise faith.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 Those that walk by Faith converse much with God; as they have higher apprehensions of God than others, so they converse much with God, for faith is that which takes off the heart from the Creature, and presently car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries it to God through the Creature: One that hath faith in continual use, when he hath to do w<seg rend="sup">th</seg> any Creature, he hath communion with the Creature, but instantly his heart is upon God in it: and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>n the use of an ordinance, present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his heart is upon God; it doth not stay in any thing, but flies to God, and nests himself in him, and converses with him; and when he awakes in the morning, present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly faith that's acted, and there it converses with God in Heavenly thoughts and meditations, and when it comes to prayer it converses with God, and when it walks up and down in the world, and sees the Sun, and Moon, and Stars, it converses with God in them; and when he hath communion with the Saints, he converses still with God: al that walk by faith they converse much with God, and therfore it's excellent.</p>
                     <p n="5">
                        <pb n="249" facs="tcp:118704:143"/>5 It's that Grace that in a more eminent way honors God; that I have many times spoken of, especially once handling the preciousness of the grace of faith, it honors God above al other graces, because it attributes nothing to the Creature, but al to God; and it glorifies that in God that God himself most glories in; as the mercies of God, and the faithfulness of God, God glorifies in his mercy and faithfulness in a more special manner; his mercy is over all his works, and faith gives glory to that in a most eminent manner, it gives God the glory of his Power too, and of his Wisdom, and of al his other Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes; <hi>Abraham</hi> beleeved, and gave glory to God: they are the men and women that glorifie God, that walk most by faith: You think if your hearts were more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly than they are, and more Heavenly-minded than you are, you should glorifie God; it's true, that would help you, but if you could beleeve more than you do, you would glorifie God more, and the other would follow of themselves.</p>
                     <p n="6">6 It's an excellent walk, the walk of faith, Because by this the soul is freed exceedingly from fears, from doubts, from misgiving thoughts in the course of it: where faith is not strengthened, a Christian walks as one in the dark, afraid of every bush; so long as a Saint is but little acquainted with this mystery of Godliness in wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king by Faith, every day what fears are there? if there be but any stirrings of corruption in his heart, then God's an enemy presently, and I am a Reprobate and a Cast-a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; such conclusions are ready to be where there is not the use of faith: and if God seem but to absent himself a little while, he is gone for ever, and never wil come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; and if the heart find temptations to come in strong, one day I shal perish by the hand of this <hi>Saul:</hi> Oh the fears, and doubts, and the misgiving thoughts, and jelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies that there are in the hearts of Saints, in their walk while they do not walk by faith; how are they bewil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred in their course, they go on a little way, and are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:118704:144"/> to seek: When the soul walks by faith, it's help'd against al these, fears, and doubts, and misgiving thoughts that some souls (if they had it) would give a world to be freed from; Oh saith some poor soul, if I could be but freed from these, what a happy life should I lead: If thou couldst learn but to exercise thy faith in the course of thy life, these would be despelled ever as the mist pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth away before the Sun; and Temptations they would little prevail with you, as I hinted before of faith, it would quench the fiery darts of the Devil; Temptations would not prevail so as they did, if the sould could but act faith more.</p>
                     <p n="7">7 Thou shalt do great things for God by walking by faith: you think your grace is but smal, and you shal never do much for God; but faith helps to do great things for God, yea, though Saints graces be but weak for the present: Those men that have the greatest measure of Sanctification, do not alwaies do the greatest things for God; but such men as can act faith most, and have the greatest measure of that, they are those that do the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test things for God here in the world, his best Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                     <p n="8">8 Besides, Thou wilt make great Progress in the waies of God, thou wilt go on apace; those that walk any other way, they walk very slowly, they walk as a sick man with his staff in his hand, he can go on but slowly; but such as can walk by faith, would have no need of the staff of Experience, and the staff of Comfort, and of Reason, and such things, such a one can walk on apace in Gods waies, yea run, if need be: A man that walks in any other walk, if he meets with any stumbling blocks, he knows not how to get over them, but one that walks by faith walks on high above stumbling blocks: if a man walks in the midst of stumbling blocks, he cannot walk fast, but if he can get above them, he rids his way more.</p>
                     <p n="9">
                        <pb n="251" facs="tcp:118704:144"/>9 What shall I speak more about the Excellency of this? It's that which causes uprightness in the heart, <hi>I am God All-sufficient, walk before me and be upright;</hi> as much as to say, <hi>Abraham,</hi> act thy faith upon me as the Al-sufficient God in al thy waies, look not upon the Creature, but upon me, and then walk before me, and be upright: What's the Reason of the unevenness of Saints walking in their way? it's for the want of Faith they walk not by Faith, and therefore if they meet with this and the other difficulty, they wil turn aside out of the way; but where the soul can walk by Faith, it doth walk in an upright line to God, and hath no fetches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout one way, nor the other.</p>
                     <p n="10">10 By walking by Faith we come to have the present enjoyment of the end of our faith, <hi>Receiving the end of our Faith, even the Salvation of our souls;</hi> it's not only you <hi>shall have</hi> the end of your faith, but you <hi>have</hi> it; <hi>Receiving</hi> the end of your Faith: the Saints have Heaven now in their hearts, every step they set they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the end of it: That's a great Excellency of it, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the end and reward of all our actions: In the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of thy Commandements there is great reward; while I am in action, I have Heaven; I enjoy God, and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and my last end, I have the blessing, the happiness of my last end in every thing I do: this is to walk by faith indeed: Many walk heavily in their Conversations, and yet have some hopes that at length they may get to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; but by walking by faith, we have Eternal Life <hi>now:</hi> Its a comfortable walk when a man is walking, and sees the end of his journey before him, that encourages him; but this is more than seeing the end of our journey, it's the enjoying of the fruit of our journey</p>
                     <p n="11">11 And then the Excellency of it is in this, That it is so useful; in al Estates and conditions we have need of faith: If God puts us in prosperity, if we do not act faith there, our prosperity wil spoil us, and slay us; If God changes our condition into adver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ity, there we must
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:118704:145"/> have the use of faith too; if we be in sickness, or in health, faith still; a single estate, married condition, whatsoever our Condition or Imployment is, yet stil faith: The usefulness of it shews the Excellency of this our walk by Faith.</p>
                     <p n="12">12 It's that which brings a good report too, a good report even by God himself; God commends this Grace above every Grace, in <hi>Heb. 11. 2. For by it the Elders obtained a good report;</hi> they were spoken ill of by men, but by their faith they obtained a good report, their names were dear and precious in the eyes of God: <hi>The Elders obtained, <gap reason="foreign">

God therefore honors Faith; according to 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 30. and gives it his testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial, as here, the Elders are Eternallized in this notable Chapter, this little Book of Martyrs, as one fitly cals it. I beseech you consider of this, you that take care of your names; Oh you cannot tell how to bear the loss of a good name, to be revil'd and contemn'd; here's the way to have a good report, it is by faith: And the truth is, though many will speak ill of you, yet go on in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant way walking by faith, and the Lord wil cleer your names; trust God for your names and liberties, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, and all, and you shal find your names wil be clee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by God, and kept by God as boxes of precious Oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. They al obtained a good report.</p>
                     <p n="13">13 Lastly, This is the Excellency of it, That it wil make one die comfortably; no such comfortable death to a man as this, When he meets with God in the end of his Walk; when death meets with him in this walk, it can never look terrible: If you have gotten out of the walk of Faith, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the walk of Sence, and the common course and road of the world, Death wil meet you, and be very terrible to you, as the King of terrors; but if death meet with you here, it wil look with a very cheerful and amiable coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance; in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. it's said, <hi>They died in Faith, not
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:118704:145"/> having received the Promises.</hi> (Only by the way ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve this concerning the last Point, and mark how the Words are twice repeated, <hi>For by it</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>the Elders obtained a good report:</hi> and then in the 39. verse, <hi>And these all having obtained a good report through Faith, received not the Promise; God having provided some better thing for us, &amp;c.</hi>) But the main place for our comfort in death is in my Text, and that which follows upon it, <hi>For</hi> (saith he) <hi>we walk by Faith, not by sight:</hi> What follows then? we are confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord; we walking by Faith, and not by Sight, then we are confident and willing rather to be absent from the Body; let death come when it wil, it shal be welcom, it cannot come amiss because we walk by faith, and not by sight: The great Reason why people are afraid of death, is because they walk by sight so much: The walking by faith, wil make the soul to be willing to be absent from the body, and to let the soul to go freely out: as when a vessel hath no vent, the liquor wil not run out, but give it vent and then it wil run out; so here when the soul is not willing to go out of the Body, let it have but a sight of those heavenly things that faith is able to let in to it, and the soul wil presently be willing to be absent from the body.</p>
                     <p>Thus then you see the Excellency of a Saints Walk by Faith.</p>

                        <p>An Exhortation to strengthen Faith by looking to the grand Covenant, when we cannot apply parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Promises, and when we can neither apply particular nor absolute Promises, by casting our selves upon Gods Attributes.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>LEt us improve this a little to stir up Saints to the strengthening Faith above al: This I find, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny souls are very careful to strengthen other Graces, and make great complaints of the want of them; but they are not so careful of this, neither do they make such com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of the want of this; few are so much troubled for the want of this, as for the want of humility, and meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and Heavenly-mindedness: You shal have many complain thus; Oh that I could get my heart more hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and more broken, then I should be happy, but Oh I have a hard heart: But get thy heart more beleeving than it is, and thou wilt be as happy: And so another com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains, Oh if I could but overcome my Passion, get the mastery of my self, and to be meek in my carriage; but if thou couldest get more Faith, that would do better, and would help against thy Passion: Oh if I could but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome my evil thoughts, and pray better, how happy were I? but rather say, Oh that I could beleeve more, and exercise Faith more, Oh that I could get influence from Jesus Christ more; and this would make thee hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py: If you walk not by Faith, you wil lose your way quickly, you wil lose the sight of the end of your Faith, and that wil discourage you; and then you wil lose your
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:118704:146"/> very way its self, and you wil be mightily ensnared, and be ready to be drawn out of your way, and stumble ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, if you exercise not Faith: But by faith you wil keep the sight of the end of your way, and keep in your way, and be delivered from stumbling blocks, from snares in your way.</p>
                     <p>Now to the end you may strengthen your Faith, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member to practice this choyce Rule:</p>
                     <p>When you cannot put forth your Faith in a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Promise, yet hold to the main Covenant, to the great and the grand Promise; and when you cannot put forth Faith in a conditional Promise, yet put it forth in an absolute Promise; somtimes I cannot see particular Promises that I can act upon, but what's the Covenant of Grace, look upon the infinite freeness and the fulness of the Covenant of Grace then.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> But it may be some wil say, <hi>I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it belongs to me or no.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Consider, There's <hi>Fulness</hi> of <hi>Grace,</hi> and <hi>Freeness</hi> of <hi>Grace</hi> in the Covenant; and therefore say, Why may it not belong to me? I am not excluded, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let me keep that before my soul in al my distresses, and the sure keeping and presenting of it before the soul, is a special means to draw forth the vertue of Faith.</p>
                     <p>And then, though I do not see a conditional Promise, I cannot apply that; as thus: When God saith, <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed are those that mourn, for they shall br comforted, and blessed are the poor in spirit;</hi> Oh I do not mourn, nor am poor in spirit; I do not find the Condition of those Promises in me; yet there are other Promises that are absolute, and carry the Condition of those Promises in them; as, <hi>I will take away the heart of stone;</hi> he doth not say, I wil take away the stony heart if you wil do thus and thus; but it's an absolute Promise to all that can cast themselves upon it, and it requires no preceding Conditions: This▪ is a mighty help in our Walk by Faith.</p>
                     <pb n="256" facs="tcp:118704:147"/>
                     <p>First, By Faith look to the grand Promise, and the Covenant in general, when you cannot apply Particulars.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Though I cannot apply a conditional Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, yet let me look unto an absolute Promise, and let my soul hang there, and that's enough to support for the present, and let me exercise Faith there: But more of this, and the helps of Faith I shal come to treat of in the next Head; that is, What the soul should do when there is the want of Sence, when God absents himself, and the soul hath lost the sence of God, and his Love, and Mercy; and when Gods Works do not seem to go with him, but rather against him; how the soul should help and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it's self in that condition; for here indeed is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly act of Faith, when al Sence fails: Oh that's the soul that walks by Faith, that knows how to make use of it when al the props of Sence fails. But of that in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Discourse.</p>
                     <p>The Life of a Saint on Earth is a mystery, for it is to walk by Faith, and no marvel though the men of the world do not understand the way of a Saint, they won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at what they mean in denying themselves, so much as they do, and doing things that they can see no reason for: hence it appears then, that it must needs be a myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the world, because it's a walk by faith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 20. is a very remarkable place for this; saith the Apostle there, <hi>I am crucified with Christ:</hi> as for al the Honors and Preferments in the world, they take nothing with me, I am crucified to them al: those that liv'd with him might stand and wonder, What's the matter? why should <hi>Paul</hi> be crucified to al the Preferments he might have had? for he was a man of great Esteem and Credit, yet he was crucified to al things; though I be crucified, yet I have a life, though I am crucified with Christ, yet I live, I have a life beyond al the things in the world; what's that? <hi>Yet not I, but Christ liveth in me,</hi> and the life which I now live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the Son of God; I am crucified, and am willing to be dead to al

                     <p>Suppose you cannot for the present have use either of Conditional Promises, or absolute Promises, yet there is some help, The Soul is to endeavor to cast it's self up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Gods Attributes, that is, to work after God that way, and do▪ what it can to close with Gods Name; I confess we can never have any assurance of Gods Love and his Mercy, til we have it in the way of the Covenant: But it's one means to help the soul after God, when it is out of the sight of a Promise, for to venture its self upon the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes of God; as upon the Mercy of God, as God is infinitely Merciful in himself; and the Power of God, and the Goodness of God: I confess these things can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fully satisfie the soul except it knows God in Christ, yet they may be some helps to keep the soul off from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from God; it's true, the Attributes of God in themselves, can never be a sufficient object for saving Faith, yet they may be some stay of the heart for the present to keep it from departing from God, and in such a way wherein it may come to find God so much the soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and that was the support of the poor woman of <hi>Canaan</hi> that we read of in the 15. of <hi>Matth.</hi> the poor woman there had no Promise to rest upon, neither Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional, nor Absolute; for when she came in the 22. ver. she cryed to Christ, <hi>saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou Son of</hi> David, <hi>my daughter is grievously vexed with a Devil: But he answered her not a word: And then his Disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away: But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.</hi> What have I to do with you?

                     <argument>
                        <p>Helps for the soul in its walking by Faith. 1 What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever our case is, we have to deal with an All-seeing God. 2 Gods Word is more to be relied upon than his Works. 3 All good that is in all Creatures is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minently in God. 4 No Creature in Heaven or Earth, hath the least power to do good or hurt, any further than God pleaseth to let out himself through them. 5 The way of God in working for his Saints, is often above, without, and contrary to means. 6 God puts the sentence of death upon a thing before he gives it. 7 Whatsoever Promise is made to any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of the people of God, that may every Godly man apply to himself, being in the same condition that he was in. 8 No Condition so comfortless as it may be a sufficient plea for unbeleef.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>BUt further, To proceed in the helping of the Soul in its walking by Faith: There are these four things that I intend to prosecute in this Point.</p>
                     <p>First, <hi>To lay before you some Principals of Faith, that Faith may help its self upon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>To give you some Encouragements unto a soul that wants all Sence; when God is quite out of sight, yet what Encouragements the soul may have.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="260" facs="tcp:118704:150"/>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>I shall lay down some Arguments to move your hearts to put forth Acts of Faith even in the want of Sence, when all is out of sight.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>Some Rules of Direction, what the soul should do in that great case of the want of Sence.</hi> These are the Four Heads, and I shal not be large in any of them.</p>
                     <p>For the First, To lay down some Conclusions or Principals that may be for the support of Faith, when Sence and Reason is at a stand.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 The first thing is this: What ever my case be, yet I have to deal with God, with the infinite and glorious God, who hath the compass of al things before him, who doth not only look upon things that are now present, but with one view he sees the whol Frame and Latitude of things. Our Knowledg is like a man that is going up to the top of a Tower, and looking through a little cranny he sees those things that are right before him: he sees not the things that are on this side, or that, only those things that are right before the cranny: But the Knowledg of God is like a mans Knowledg that is on the top of a Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; if there be an Army of men in the field, with one view he can see them all: Now for the soul when it is in any straights, to look thus upon God, I have to deal with that God that hath the Compass, the Latitude, the Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sues of al things before him: therfore upon this, see how Faith helps its self. Though I cannot <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ee how such and such a thing can be, yet I have to deal with an infinite God that sees al before him, and he may see waies and means that I cannot see, and although I think that such a thing tends to such and such an evil, yet God he looks beyond the present, and may see a great deal or good co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming a long time after by those things that seems to be very hurtful for the present. The great Reason why men
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:118704:150"/> beleeve not; and when Sence and Reason is at a stand, their hearts sink, because they look no higher than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, they look not at God that hath the compass of all things in his view; if they did, this would quiet them; as a child when he is at a stand, and knows not what to do, he wil commit himself unto his Father, and thinks, my Father knows: So should we do when we are at a stand, we should consider that we have to deal with a God that hath the Latitudes and Issues of al things in his eyes at one view.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 The Second Principle that I would lay down for the help of our Faith in the want of sight, is this: That Gods Word is more to be stuck unto than his Works, we are more to rely upon a Word, than upon a Work of God; that's a Principle that would be a mighty help to Faith: Let's search and see whether we have a Word to warrant us in our way, whether any Word of God holds forth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny comfort to us.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> You will say, <hi>When I read the Word, I have some comfort; Oh but when I see how things are working, then I am quite taken off.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Lay up this as an everlasting Principle, That Gods Word is more to be rested upon, than the Works of God; for God puts his Word as an Object of our Faith, but God never makes any single work of his to be the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of our Faith; as we have had occasion already to shew you how that Gods Works many times doth seem to be quite contrary to his Word: As take one work sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle without reference unto another work, and it would be quite contrary to his Word; as I remember I instanced in that of <hi>Abraham,</hi> when God promised him to make his Seed as the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ars of Heaven, and yet he must kill his Son; the Work that God would have him to do, was quite contrary to his Word; and then to bid him go from his own Country into the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> that flowed with Milk and Honey; the first thing that he meets with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, was a famine in the Land of <hi>Canaan:</hi> Oh therefore
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:118704:151"/> rest on the Word of God rather than on any Work of his, for we cannot, nor God would not have us to understand his Works many times; God loves to be in the dark in his Works, but his Word is light; the Scripture saith, that Gods Waies are in the dark, but his Word is alwaies called light, therefore that's to be rested upon.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 The third Principle to help our Faith in the want of Sight and Sence, is this; That all good that is in all Creatures in the World, is eminently in God himself, in the very Being of God; that so the soul enjoyes al the good there is in al Creatures: I beseech you observe it, When the soul enjoyes God, it doth not only enjoy a good that is better than all Creatures, that every one wil say, that the mercy of God, and the goodness of God are higher and better than al the good that there is in al Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; no, but we must understand it yet further than that; not only that he enjoyment of God is better than having all Creatures, but we must understand thus, That al Creatures in the world, whatsoever good they have for doing any good, all that power, and sweetness, and comfort that is scattered up and down in several Creatures, it's al united in God in one; that while I have the Lord, I have al power in al Creatures whatsoever; that's a mighty Principle of Faith: For now I want sight, it may be I see this and the other Creature work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing against me, and I see the want of help in one, and the want of help in the other; but if I can have a real sight of God, to see al the good that is in al Creatures to be in him; this is a wonderful support: then if I have to do with nothing but God himself, I have enough, for I have al there in him: As though a man hath not such and such Herbs that grows in a Garden, perhaps he hath neither Rosemary, nor Time, nor Sweet-marjoram, yet if he hath the Water, that is still'd out of these Herbs, he hath the Vertue and Quintessence that is in every one of them: So the soul that hath union with God, and por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Almighty, hath the Quintessence, and Vertue,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:118704:151"/> and Efficacy of al Creatures in God himself: That's the Third great Principle in the helping of Faith in the want of sight and sence, in any case of trouble that the soul is in.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 The fourth Principle of Faith is this, That all Creatures that we look upon as those that may afford us any help; al their power depends upon God, they have power neither to do good or hurt any further than God doth give out his power, and doth concur with them; no Creature in Heaven or Earth, hath the least power to do the least hurt, any further than God is pleased to let out himself through those Creatures; he hath the abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute command of all. These things are granted in the general, and you are ready to say, Who doth not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand them? It's true, it's an easie matter to convince men of that, but if it comes to examination, the very ground of the shaking of our Faith when we meet with any trouble, ariseth from the want of the use of these Principles: Let these be laid to the heart, and let there be a right and a sound understanding of these, and it will be a mighty help to our Faith.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 The fifth Principle for our Faith is this, That the way of God in working for his Creatures, is a way often beyond al means whatsoever; God doth delight in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king (and especially for his Servants) beyond al means of al Creatures, and contrary unto means; above means, without means, and contrary unto means; this is the way of God in his working for his Saints. I confess the way that God uses to work for others (for the men of the world) it is but the way of a general Providence. It is a very useful Consideration this one Note, to consider the difference of the working of God towards the generality of the men of the world, and the working of God in re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to his Saints: The working of God towards the men of the world, is the working of his general Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and no further, they can expect no more; and if God work any further towards them, to bring good to
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:118704:152"/> them, or to help them, God hath a special aim to som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what beyond them: But for his working towards his Saints, there's the right hand of God stretcht out, the right hand of Gods power, and it's glorious in Excellency, that is, God in working for the good of his Saints, takes a great deal of delight in going beyond al means, without means, contrary unto means; and indeed those actions of God that he doth mind his Saints more specially in, are such: And hence are al those expressions that you have, of the right hand of God, and the excellency of his power; the excellency of his power is over <hi>Jacob:</hi> it's true, it's the Power of God that works al good to al Creatures in the world, and God causes his general Providence to be working for good to them; but <hi>his Excellency is over Jacob;</hi> that is, to work beyond, without, and contrary unto means; ther's the glory of God. Saith God when he works for his people, such kind of works as are ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary for me to do when I am working for others, wil not serve turn to manifest my love and respect to my Saints, no, I'le go beyond, and without, and contrary to them.</p>
                     <p>Oh that this might have a double use upon our hearts, not only to strengthen our Faith, that when means are wanting, and come short, and seem to go contrary, yet to walk by Faith. Oh but let us likewise learn by the way from hence to be more than ordinary in our Service for God, he is more than ordinary in his working towards us: For the soul to lay up this, and to take this as for granted, That God in his special working for his People and Churches, he works otherwise than he doth for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, he works beyond, and without, and contrary un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to means; and he commonly doth use to put the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of death upon a thing before he gives it.</p>
                     <p n="6">6 And that may be in the sixth place: That God in his dealings towards his people, he seldom uses to do any great matters for them, but he doth use to put the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of death first upon it before it's done, he doth not
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:118704:152"/> use to come to help till just they are ready to die, until al seems to be gone, then their extremity is his oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity; God would not give <hi>Abraham</hi> a child til <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rahs</hi> womb was dead, and he was as it were dead: so if you examine the waies of God towards his people, he usually brings them into the shadow of death, and there is a sentence of death, and then appears the grace and mercy of God towards his people, and so the Apostle speaks of Gods dealing towards him, in 2 <hi>Cor. 1. 8, 9. We were pressed out of measure, above strength, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that we despaired even of life; but</hi> (saith he) <hi>we had the</hi> SENTENCE<note place="margin">
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>the Answer, or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation of Death.</hi>
                        </note> OF DEATH <hi>in our selves:</hi> But to what end? <hi>That we should not trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead:</hi> Hope is never higher elevated, than when our state in all mens eyes is at the lowest: You must not therefore when you find your condition brought so low, as to say, this is beyond al my strength, and God doth not use to tempt his people beyond their strength, and therefore surely God is gone, help is gone; no, now is the time for God to come if ever, when the Sentence of death is put upon a people: Oh how often have you found God somtimes coming in, when you have given up al at Sea, and if the wind had not turned just at that instant you had been gone; but then hath been the time for God to come and work for your deliverance when the Sentence of death hath been upon you, because God would have al the glory of it to himself: And that's a sixt Principle.</p>
                     <p n="7">7 A Seventh is this: Whatsoever Promise we have in al the Book of God to any particular of the people of God, that Promise may every godly man apply unto himself being in the same condition that he was in: If you read in the Book of God how he hath dealt with any of his Saints when they have been in any extremity or difficulty, God hath given out Promises to them to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cor
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:118704:153"/> them, that is a Warrant for thee to lay hold upon that Promise as if it were made to thee in particular; and this is a great help to Faith. These two Scriptures are generally known, the Promise that God made to <hi>Joshua,</hi> he said, <hi>I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee:</hi> Now the Apostle in the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> doth apply it to the Christians that liv'd in those times, <hi>For God hath said</hi> (saith he) <hi>I will never leave you, nor forsake you:</hi> They might have said, this Promise was made to <hi>Joshua,</hi> and not to us: yet that way of the Apostle in applying the Promise, is a general Rule to us, that whensoever we find any Promise in Scripture concerning any particular godly man, we have warrant to make use of that as if so be that God had called to us from Heaven by name, and said <hi>Thomas,</hi> or <hi>Richard,</hi> I wil do this and this for thee: That's a Seventh Principle for Faith.</p>
                     <p n="8">8 The Eighth thing that I would lay down to help Faith in the time of the want of Sight, is this, That there is no condition that any of the People of God can be in, no condition so dark, and so wanting comfort, as is a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Plea for Unbeleef: Though thy condition be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so dark and dismal in thine own eyes, yet remember, it can never be so dark, so dismal, so void of comfort, of help, as should give thee any ground▪ for thy Unbeleef. I'le give you one Scripture that may serve instead of all for this, In <hi>Isa. 50. 10. Who is among you that feareth the Lord? that obeyeth the voyce of his Servant? that walk in darkness, and hath no light? Let him trust in the Name of the Lord, and stay himself upon his God:</hi> Who is there that walketh in darkness, and hath no light? no light at al, nothing but black darkness, dismal dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; You walk in darkness because your walk is not the walk of Faith: But who is it that walks in darkness, and sees no light of comfort at al? what should he do? Let him trust in the Name of the Lord, and stay upon his God.</p>
                     <pb n="267" facs="tcp:118704:153"/>
                     <p>It is, Whosoever is among you that <hi>feareth</hi> the Lord: It's those indeed that fear God, so they must be qualified, and their desires are to obey the voyce of his Servants; mark, the holy Spirit speaks of two things that Godly People in their greatest weaknesses may find: That is,</p>
                     <p>First, The fear of God is upon their hearts, indeed although they cannot do as others of the Saints, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not overcome their corruptions as they, yet the fear of God is upon them.</p>
                     <p>And then Secondly, <hi>That obeyeth the voyce of his Servant:</hi> They can appeal to God that knoweth all things that there's nothing their souls more desires than to be obedient to God, speaking by his Servants to their souls; and though it's true, they have not power to do the thing that is required▪ yet there is the obedience of the heart: Well then, <hi>Who is it?</hi> Whosoever it be, though never so weak, though never such stirrings of corruption in them, yet if they thus fear God, and their hearts lie under the Authority of his Word, so as to be willing to yield obedience to the voyce of God by his Servants, though he walks in darkness, and sees no light, he sees no comfort, no way of succor for him, yet let him trust in the Name of the Lord, and stay upon his God, so that there is no condition so dark and dismal to any that desire to fear the Lord, and walk in his ways, but they may have exercise of their Faith in trusting in the Name of the Lord, and staying upon their God. And thus you have these Principles laid down for to ground your Faith up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which you should lay next to your hearts, for you may have use of every one of these in your walk.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>Encouragements to the soul in its walking by Faith. 1 God tenders himself to all to whom the Gospel comes, in a Covenant of Grace, and not of Works. 2 All the good that God doth for his Creatures, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially in order to eternal Life, is for his Names sake. 3 There is no qualification in the Creature that is made by God as a condition to our belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. 4 It is the great Glory of God, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign that he hath in the world, to glorifie himself in the way of his free Grace, and faithfulness towards men. 5 It's as delightful to Christ to have the end of his Death, as to us to have our souls saved. 6 God leaves his People without Sence of his love for many good ends to them. 7 God hath more Glory in saving than in casting off.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>AS for Encouragements to the soul in its walking by Faith; consider of these Particulars.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 That God doth tender himself unto all those to whom the Gospel comes, so as he is willing to deal with them in the way of a Covenant of Grace, and not a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works: This is a special help and Encouragement to the soul that is in darkness, and sees no light, who hath no sence of the Presence, and Love, and Mercy of God, yet O thou soul look up to God; Oh the sight of God will such a soul say, is terrible to me; The Lord is a consuming fire, and who can stand before the everlasting Burnings? Oh who can endure the consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming fire? But Oh thou soul look up again, and behold
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:118704:154"/> the Lord tendering himself to deal with thee in the way of the Covenant of Grace.</p>
                     <p>Object. <hi>I but, I do not know whether I am under the Covenant of Grace.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Yet when thy Ears hears the glad tydings of the Gospel, know that that's nothing else but God coming to tender himself to thy soul in the way of a Covenant of Grace: Had we to deal with God in a way of a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of works, <hi>Cursed is every soul that abides not in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing that is written in the book of the law to do it;</hi> then every thought of God might be very terrible to us, and I verily beleeve that it's the main ground that holds many under a spirit of bondage, and causes them to walk in a disconsolate, and distressed condition, and cannot walk by Faith, because they look upon God as having to deal with him in the way of a Covenant of Works; they see God to be a Holy, and Just, and Righteous God, and they see his Law Righteous; now they are conscious to themselves of having broken his Law, and their Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences being defil'd with evil works, and having guiltiness upon them through the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>r sin, upon this God is terrible to them, and they are not able to put forth any acts of faith to beleeve in him.</p>
                     <p>But on the other side, Could this soul come to behold God tendering himself to it, to deal with it in the way of a Covenant of Grace, and the Lord speaking thus, for so he doth, Oh you wretched sinful soul who art cast and undone by the Covenant of Works that first was made with man-kind, you are undone, and by that must pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish for ever: But behold, there is a Second Covenant, a Covenant of Grace, wherein I am willing to have to deal with the Children of men, and through that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant that I have made, that is, <hi>Beleeve and Live,</hi> and I am he that justifies the ungodly; and in that Covenant there is a way of satisfaction for the Sons of Men, and there is acceptation even of the desires, and endeavors of the souls of poor Creatures that are otherwise ful of sin;
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:118704:155"/> yet acceptation there is through the Covenant, of their souls, and that to Eternal Life; and it is through that Covenant that I am willing to have to do with the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men, with you in particular to whom my Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel comes to be preached; not to deal with you meerly as I am the Creator of al things, and you Creatures, as I Holy, and you Sinful; but willing to deal with you through my Son, and to apply the purchase that my Son hath made: Oh if we could but come to see the Lord so, in the midst of al fears and troubles we might come to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise our Faith, and to walk by Faith rather than by Sence; beholding God in this manner, and indeed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the beholding of God thus we shal never be able to step a step of Faith in our walk: And that's the first Encouragement.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 The Second is this, That all the good that God doth for his Creatures, especially in order to Eternal Life is for his own Name sake, it is out of free Grace, and nothing else; it is because Mercy pleaseth him, <hi>Mic.</hi> 7. 18. it's not because you can please him, for he will have mercy on whom he wil have mercy, and whom he wil he hardens; it is meerly because he delights in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, it's from Arguments that are in his own Bowels, and not from Arguments that are or can be in thee or any Creature: What an Encouragement is here for the soul to exercise Faith? a soul that walks in darkness and can see no light, I see nothing in mine own heart but a dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon of dismal darkness; Oh but I hear that the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of al Gods goodness unto his Creatures, of all the good that he doth for his Creatures in order to Eternal Life, is meerly out of free grace, and because mercy plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses him; then why may there not be a way for me then to exercise Faith, though my condition be never so sad in its self: That's the Second Encouragement.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 The Third is this, That there is no qualifications in the Creature that is made by God as a Condition of our beleeving: God doth not say, that if you be thus and
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:118704:155"/> thus, that then you have right to beleeve, and so you shal come to have right to Christ, <hi>There is nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Faith, that gives right unto Faith:</hi> Indeed there may be somthing before that may take away some hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derances, and lets, and so may help us towards beleeving; but nothing before Faith that can give us a right to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving; therefore for men to say, How do I know that I have a right to beleeve? If thou canst beleeve, thy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving gives thee a right to beleeve; 'tis my beleeving makes me to have interest in the Riches, and in the Grace of the Covenant to apply it to my self, but there's nothing can give me a right to beleeve: If the Gospel be preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and I find the Lord working upon my heart to draw me to beleeve, the Lord gives me liberty to it, that is, not that I may conceit that I have my part in Christ: All to whom the Gospel is preached, they have right to this: if they can find that in their hearts, to cast and noul their souls upon the infinite, free, ful, and rich Grace of God in the Gospel, they may do it; and they need not stand to plead whether it be not too much boldness in them so to do, for thou art invited to do it freely, <hi>Come and drink of the Waters of Life freely;</hi> and you that have no money, no worthiness at al in you, yet the way is made over to you as wel as to others: And that's a Third Encouragement.</p>
                     <p>And if at the first time when we come to beleeve; there be then no qualifications required to give us interest to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, then surely at al other times we are not to reason, That because I am thus and thus, therefore I may not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve; let thy condition be as bad as it can be afterwards, yet surely it is not worse than it was at the first of all, thou art not more off than before, or at least it cannot be so ill but that this Rule may encourage thee.</p>
                     <p>Yea, though they have sin'd against knowledg, and after profession of Religion, yet still this holds a truth that there is no precedent qualifications gives thee right to beleeving, it doth but that which may make way, and
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:118704:156"/> take away hinderances, and therefore thou may est be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged in the want of al sight and sence, yet stil to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise thy Faith.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 The Fourth Encouragement, That it is the great glory of God, and design that he hath in the world to glorifie himself in the way of his free grace, and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness towards the children of men: God doth delight in the glory of his Power, in the glory of his Wisdom, in the glory of his Bounty, in the glory of his Justice; but the great Master-piece above al things, is the glory of his Grace, in the Glory of the Riches of his Grace, and Mercy, and Faithfulness, it is that the Lord delights more in, than he doth in making the World: God as he hath made one World, so he could make a thousand Worlds by the Word of his Power: If God pleased, he could make a thousand Worlds more by one Word; yet God doth not so much delight in making of Worlds, as in shewing forth the riches of his Grace to poor wretched Creatures that have undone themselves: That's the great Master-piece of God that he will be honored in to al Eternity: Now when as the soul shall think, If that Mercy may do me good, that shal be so great as God shal have the chief Glory of above al his Works, and that God takes most delight in above al other of his Attributes, if that mercy wil do me good, then this is tendered to me in the Word, and therefore I may have Encouragement to beleeve.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 Another is this, That as it is Gods great design to magnifie his Grace above al his Works, so it's as delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to Christ to enjoy the end of his death, as it can be to any of you to have your souls saved: Christ takes as much pleasure in, and accompts it as great a good to him to have the End of his death, as any of you can accompt it to have your souls eternally sav'd: You think thus, Oh such and such a Mercy that I have need of, what a benefit would it be to me if God would grant me this mercy; but if God would save my
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:118704:156"/> soul, pardon my sin, and bring me to eternal Life, how happy should I be? What is thy heart set upon such a Mercy, and doest thou so prize the pardon of thy sin, and the saving of thy soul? thou canst not prize it more than Christ prizes the fruit of his death, thou canst not get more good by thy Salvation, than Christ shal get by having the purchase which he purchased by his death; you know the Scripture in <hi>Isa. 53. He shall see the travel of his soul, and he shall be satisfied, for by his knowledg shall my righteous Servant justifie many:</hi> This is the travel of Christs soul to bring sinners to be justified, and when Christ sees this, he is satisfied: If thou should'st see the Salvation of thy soul, and God should as it were in a Map shew thee all that glory that thou should'st have in Heaven to al Eternity, would not this satisfie thee? Now when Christ sees the travel of his soul, that is, in bringing Life and Salvation for sinners, this is as great a satisfaction to the heart of Christ as thy Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on can be to thine own soul: The consideration of this, may be useful to help thee to beleeve in the want of all Sence whatsoever.</p>
                     <p n="6">6 The next is this, That God withdrawing himself from his People, and bringing of them into such a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wherein they are without al kind of sence of his Love, and nothing but darkness; the Lord in this hath many good ends why he doth it: He doth that which is very sad to the hearts of his people, yet it is not so evil but God many times hath excellent ends for which he doth do it, he takes his Servants off from the props of the Creature, and from the prop of Sence and Reason to the end that he may be All in All to them; if there were no other end why God did withdraw himself from his Creatures, but that he might shew to them what their condition were like to be for ever, but only that he might eternally forsake them, if God had never any other end, then thou mayest be much discouraged in the want of sence: But consider what an Encouragement is here for
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:118704:157"/> thee to think thus, Indeed my condition is sad, but hath God no other ends but only to forsake his Creature? have not I heard out of the Word many times that God hath very gracious ends, and that he doth not only aim at his own glory, but at the good of his Creature in with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing himself, and much good hath come by it, it hath been a means to withdraw the hearts of his Servants from the Creature, and to unite them more▪ strongly to himself: Then why should not I make the best Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of Gods dealings as may be? I was before afraid that surely God had utterly forsaken me; but when I hear this, that he hath many gracious ends why he doth for the present withdraw himself from the hearts of his People; not only many good ends why he doth <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly</hi> afflict his people, that many are convinc'd of; Oh but that God should intend good in withdrawing himself from their <hi>Souls,</hi> that they cannot see so much: But Oh thou afflicted soul, that art tossed with tempests and with temptations and troubles, know that God hath many times gracious ends even in withdrawing himself from the very souls of his Servants. God withdrew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self from the very Soul of Christ for a time, for so he cries out, <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</hi> therefore do not think that it is alwaies in hatred, and so as it wil be a certain forerunner of Gods separation from thee: Certainly God did at that time love his own Son dearly, when he did cry out so; and indeed that may be a mighty help to our Faith, when we consider not only what God doth do many times to his dear Saints, but to his own Son; and consider that God did not withdraw himself from Christ only for satisfaction (for so it was) and to shew that we had deserved that the Lord should eternally withdraw himself from us, but it was that he might be a merciful High-Priest to us; as in <hi>Heb. 4. We have not an High-Peiest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, but was in all points tempted like as we are: In all Points;</hi> why? you are
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:118704:157"/> tempted with Poverty, Christ was; you are tempted with Disgrace, Christ was: I but I am tempted with inward and Spiritual afflictions, with Gods withdrawing the Sence of his Love, and Mercy, and Goodness, what should I do there? Christ was tempted so too; <hi>In all things,</hi> the Scripture saith; And why was he tempted? it was, That he might be made sensible of our Infirmities, that he might be a compassionate High-Priest to us; and therefore mark the Exhortation that follows upon it in the 16. verse, <hi>Let us therefore come boldly unto the Throne of Grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find Grace to help in time of need.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So I shal conclude for the present with that Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; You want Sight and Sence, Oh walk by Faith, and let this be an Encouragement and help to thee for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercising of thy Faith, That we have such a High-Priest that was toucht with the feeling of our Infirmities; and among other particulars even in that, <hi>My God, My God, why hast thou forsaken me?</hi> and I make no question but it was one special end why we have this very suffering of Christ in his soul recorded in the Scripture, and it was when he was afflicted outwardly, yet then he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly afflicted at the sam time; Christ was apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as a Malefactor, and so accused, he was imprisoned, and forsaken by his friends, he was in the hands of wicked men, yea, in the hands of wicked men so as to be put to death by them, and there made a gazing stock to al the World, and scorned at in the midst of his afflictions: we do not use to scorn at men when they suffer, though they suffer for their sin; but Christ was scorned at: now if ever there were a time for God to shine upon him, and to give him the sence of his Love, one would think it should be now; Oh no, but now at this time God withdraws himself from him so far as he cries out in the Agony and bitterness of his soul, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? You are to make a Two-fold Use of it.</p>
                     <p>First, That here is a satisfaction to Gods Justice,
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:118704:158"/> Christ by being forsaken for a time hath delivered al Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers from being forsaken by God Eternally.</p>
                     <p>And it is likewise an Use of very great moment, that Beleevers should make of it, Christ is set <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ut▪ as a Pattern before us, and we are to arm our selves with the same mind.</p>
                     <p>And he is set forth unto us as a High-Priest to shew unto us that he was put under such temptations as these are, to the end he might pitty us, and have compassion on us in our temptations, and tryals, to the end our Faith might be helped, if we should ever be brought to such a condition, to be without Sence, so as to look upon God in the greatest of our afflictions to have forsaken us, yet then cast up an Eye to Jesus Christ, and behold him thus forsaken, and know as here is satisfaction to justifie for thee; so here you have an example of Gods dealing with his own Son whom his soul loved, for certainly the soul of God did alwaies love him, <hi>I know Father, thou al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies hearest me,</hi> and so he did alwaies love him: Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the Lord had gracious ends in forsaking of him, and this is set out as a Pattern to thee for the helping of thy Faith when all Sence is wanting; and had we no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in all the Book of God to help us to exercise Faith in the want of Sence, but only this example of Christ, and the dealings of God the Father with him, it were sufficient to help us to walk by Faith when we have no sight nor sence.</p>
                     <p>The walk of a Saint is the walk of Faith; there's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing manifests us to be Saints but this, The walking by Faith, and not by Sence.</p>
                     <p>I shal ad one further Encouragement that may help very much, especially to a soul that is humbled before God, and is panting after the grace of God.</p>
                     <p>Consider, When you are afraid that God should cast you off because you have no sence of his Love, what should God get by it if he cast you off? If you can but bring it to this, That God shal get as much by receiving
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:118704:158"/> you, and saving you, as he shal have by casting you off, why should you not have encouragement to beleeve and exercise Faith in the want of Sence? When you have the most dismal thoughts of al, and Sence is furthest off, what do you think God wil get, if he should cast you off?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> You wil say, <hi>He shall have the Glory of his Will, he shall shew forth the absoluteness of his Will in it, and what should I look any further, what reason God may have?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To that I Answer thus:</p>
                     <p>First, God may have the glory of his Will, and yet save you too; yea, and have the glory of his Will rather more in saving such a soul that's making after him, than he should have in casting of him off: And surely if God may have a great deal more glory, then you may have a great deal of encouragement to beleeve.</p>
                     <p>For if he hath the glory of his Will, <hi>It's but his Will upon you;</hi> but in saving of you, he may have the glory of his <hi>Will of you,</hi> and that's more glory: you shall <hi>pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively</hi> glorifie his Will, that is, you shall be a Subject, as God may make it to appear before Men and Angels that he may do what he pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e with you: But when you shal come and subject to his Will, and lie down at his feet, he hath the glory of his Will <hi>Actively</hi> upon you, and this is more.</p>
                     <p>Again, God shal have the glory of his Power by ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting of you off; I but when you come and fall down before him, and tremble at his Presence, he hath it more.</p>
                     <p>Yea, and he hath the glory of his Power in shewing mercy, as wel as in destruction: we have a notable Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for that in the Book of <hi>Numbers,</hi> chap. 14. ver. 17. <hi>Moses</hi> is pleading for the people, and now saith he, <hi>I beseech thee let the power of my Lord be great, according as thou hast spoken, saying, The Lord is long suffering, and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity and transgression:</hi>
                        <pb n="378" facs="tcp:118704:159"/> Let the <hi>Power</hi> of my Lord be great, so that it seems the Power of God appears in forgiving iniquity and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression, as much as in destruction: If God should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy thee, indeed a glorious power of his would appear in thy ruine; but there wil appear as glorious a power of his in forgiving thee as in destroying; and may not this be a great encouragement to exercise Faith in the want of Sence.</p>
                     <p>Object. <hi>I but God's a Just God, and delights in the Glory of his Justice, and he will have the Glory of his Justice it may be upon me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Nay, but thou mayest be encouraged to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in this, Because he may have as much glory of his Justice in saving thee, as in destroying thee, yea, and he may have it more in saving thee, than in destroying thee.</p>
                     <p>For first, Thou tremblest before Gods Justice: if there were no more than that, for the heart from a free act, not from a forced act, but freely; even that, is as great a glory of Gods Justice as God hath from all the damned in Hell: In destroying of the Creature God hath not more glory of his Justice than when the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture shal by a free work, and not by a forced work, come in and tremble before Gods Justice, and subject it's self to the Justice of God, and acknowledg Gods Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Justice, if the Lord should destroy it: The glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that he hath upon the damned, it's but Passive, and that is not so much; but the glory of his Justice he hath in thee, in that thou doest freely come and acknowledg it, and tremble before it, he hath it actively, and this is more.</p>
                     <p>But Secondly, There is a way for God to have the glory of his Justice, and yet to save thee.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> You wil say, <hi>Though I come freely to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg Gods Justice, yet Gods Justice is not glorified fully.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="379" facs="tcp:118704:159"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> I but there is a way wherein God may save thee, and yet have the glory of his Justice fully; And that is in Jesus Christ. Now what a transcendent En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement is this to beleeve then, when there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that can be conceived wherein God shal have glory one way, but he may have it the other way, and have it more abundantly. If God doth destroy a Creature, to what end is it, but that he might have glory? Now if God may have his glory, and save a Creature, may not that Creature have hope and ground to beleeve then? when as the Lord hath provided such a way of Salvation as his glory shall be no loser at al? And especially this, when the soul considers that God hath begun already such a work upon it, wherein he is in a way of glorify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself in the soul as much as if he should have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed it. And thus much for the Encouragements of beleeving in the want of Sence.</p>
                     <p>I am willing to be somwhat large in this Point because it is so needful: Though I may treat of things that are but as riddles to many, yet to those souls that want the Sence of Gods Love, these things wil not be too large to such, but their hearts will greedily imbrace them. But because the want of beleeving in the want of Sence, is easier to speak of than to do, for it is one of the hardest things that are to beleeve in the want of Sence; therefore I will further proceed in way of Motives, to labor to draw the heart to the work of Beleeving.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>Motives to draw the heart to beleeve in want of Sence. 1 There's as great humility, and obedience to God in beleeving, as in any other way. 2 It is the safest way in the want of all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ence to exercise Faith. 3 It is the soonest way to get the sence of Gods Love. 4 It is the proper time for Faith to act. 5 It is a glorious thing to beleeve in want of Sence. 6 It is that which honors God more than any other Grace. 7 It argues very much love to God. 8 Faith is wrought by the Almighty Power of God.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THe First is this: The great hindrance of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in the want of Sence is this, The heart thinks that the work of Beleeving, and the work of Humility will hardly stand together; it thinks thus, that it is not fit for me to beleeve, but to be humbled before God, I, it is for others; they may beleeve, but I am a wretched vile Creature, and the work that I have to do is to be humbled.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Therefore the First Motive is this: That there is as great Humility and Obedience to God in beleeving as in any other way: and so this wil take away the Two Grand Hinderances of Beleeving: That is,</p>
                     <p>First, That it is for me to be humbled. And</p>
                     <p>Secondly, That I am very sinful, and it's for me to look rather to walk in obedience to God, and to do what God requires, before I should beleeve in the Grace of God.</p>
                     <pb n="381" facs="tcp:118704:160"/>
                     <p>Now Humility and Obedience are as eminent in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving, as in any way whatsoever it can be made eminent in. It a Creature would study wherein to shew the greatest Humility and Obedience, it must be in belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in the want of Sence, for there is much self denial in it; for the heart of man is set upon this, It would fain have somthing in its self: Faith it is an emptying grace, for to deny its own thoughts, and to venture its self against its own Sence; here is a great deal ol humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for men to do things when they see no Reason and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement for it: As a Servant, though he be not very humble, nor obedient, yet he wil do some works if he hath present encouragement before his Eyes, and sees present Reason for it: But here's the tryal of an obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Servant, If he be required to do that which he sees no encouragement for before his eyes, nor able to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the Reason of such a thing: though it's true, it is his Masters wil that he should do it, yet he rather apprehends there wil come a great deal of trouble upon it, rather than good; yet if he doth it at the command of his Master, he shews himself humble and obedient in this: So certainly Humility and Obedience is shewn as much in this grace as in any: that's the most humble, and most obedient Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian that is the most beleeving Christian, <hi>This is the Command of God, that you should beleeve in his Son:</hi> THE Command of God, above all other Commands, that you should beleeve in his Son: And when the holy Spirit expresses the Subjection of the heart to God, he doth express it in the subjection of it to the Gospel in the way of beleeving in Christ whether there be Sence or no; in <hi>Rom. 10. 3. For they being ignorant of Gods Righteousness, and going about to establish their own Righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the Righteousness of God;</hi> so that you see that this is a great submission for the heart, for the heart to rest upon a Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness above its self, a Righteousness that is in Christ, and when it sees no Righteousness in it self, yet to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:118704:161"/> to the Righteousness of Christ: I have many times thought that if I were thus and thus, God would shew Mercy to me, but the Lord hath withdrawn himself, and I am a wretched vile Creature: But the Gospel presents the Righteousness of Christ, and you must submit all your thoughts to the Righteousness of Christ: Here's the submission of your hearts. Those that are humble before God for the want of Sence, they think with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves that they are willing to submit to God; if you should ask them, Would not you fain bring your hearts to be willing to submit to God? Oh yes, Oh that I could do it: If you would submit to him in any thing, submit to the Righteousness of Christ, submit al your thoughts, and al the Reasonings of your minds that are against the Righteousness of Christ, submit them to the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Christ: Here's Humility, here's Obedience, for the soul to give up its self to the Workmanship of God; it's true, I have nothing in my self, but I give up my self to the Workmanship of God and Christ, to do with me what he pleases. Here is Evangelical Obedience.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 A Second Motive, It's the safest way in the want of al Sence to exercise Faith: What wilt thou do O thou poor Soul that hast no sence of the Love of God in Christ? Thou wilt be glad to take the safest way; cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly this is the safest, for if thou thinkest when thou wantest Sence, to be striving and laboring in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of duty til Sence comes, and then thou wilt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, thou doest not take the safest way indeed; but if thou canst cast thy self upon Free Grace as it's tendred in the Gospel: this is safer than any other way, for you shal see the danger of the other.</p>
                     <p>There is a great deal of danger in the putting thy self under a Covenant of Works; if thou goest the other way to work, as what <hi>Paul</hi> saith concerning Circumcisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>If ye be circumcised, Christ profits you nothing:</hi> Why circumcised? Because that was an eminent work
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:118704:161"/> of the Law which was required of them, and indeed a Seal to the whol Law; though it was a Seal too of the Gospel, and of the Righteousness of Faith, yet it was an eminent work of the Law besides, that those that were circumcised bound themselves to the Law in it, and therefore Christ did not profit them: So if you think to get Joy, and the Comforts of the holy Spirit in any other way but beleeving, you are in danger to put your selves out of the Covenant of Grace into a Covenant of Works.</p>
                     <p>And besides, There's very much danger in it this way, Because that by seeking to get it in working and laboring in the performance of Duties, thou art in danger never to have it, for it's never like to come that way, but by our beleeving, thou mayest be working any other way all thy life time, and never come to have it: Or if thou shouldest come to have it that way, and so if thou thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest to ground thy Faith upon thy Sence still, it will be move dangerous; if thou shouldest have some joy and encouragement by thy striving, and then ground thy Faith upon that, thou art like to miscarry in thy Faith, and that Faith like to come to nothing in the conclusion: It's a dangerous thing to ground Faith upon Sence; yet many of us do rather seek to have our Faith the fruit of our Joy, than to have our Joy the fruit of our Faith; whereas▪ we should rather lay the Foundation of Faith, and then the Joy that comes after, that's right: If after an act of beleeving you come to have joy, that joy is right; but if after an act of Joy, and work of Sence, you then think you can beleeve, you may suspect that Faith not to be right: Indeed <hi>Good Works are a Nurse to Faith, but good Works are never to be the Mother of Faith.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But further, It's safe in this, Because it wil free you from danger of temptations: If so be that you be striving and strugling by Duties to get the Sence of Gods Love, if that be the thing and not by the exercise of Faith, you
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:118704:162"/> will be liable to many temptations: As thus, you will be striving and strugling, but will not get strength, and then comes a Temptation; I have labor'd, and striven, and nothing comes of it, and therefore surely God loves me not.</p>
                     <p>Yea, There wil be this Temptation: Were not I as good break off and leave off al, I see nothing comes of my Duties; and so you wil have a temptation to turn aside after vanity, you wil be weary of the performance of Duty within a while, though now you set upon it; therefore it's the safest way for the exercising of Faith at the first in the want of Sence, to look upon the grace of God in Christ as it's tendered, and to cast the soul upon it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> I but you wil say, <hi>Though there may be danger in my standing upon Sence, yet I should exercise Faith presently, there's danger of presuming, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by avoiding one evil, I should run upon another.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> To help you against this, I shall shew you what Presumption is.</p>
                     <p>First, Presumption is this, It is to trust in Gods Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy out of Christ; that's the first thing in Presumption, and the most men in the world that do presume, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume upon this ground, Because they hope in Gods Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, but they do not apprehend the Mystery of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, how Gods Mercy is to be let out unto them through Christ, and that there is not any one drop of Gods Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy but is to be communicated through Christ, and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way; yet most men they rely upon Gods Mercy, and hope that God that made them will save them, and so trust upon Gods mercy out of Christ: Whatsoever hopes of Gods Mercy thou hast out of Christ is presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for no Creature hath any thing to do with mercy, but in and through Christ: But perhaps those that live under the Gospel wil say no, they wil not trust in God but through Christ.</p>
                     <pb n="385" facs="tcp:118704:162"/>
                     <p>But then the Second thing is a trusting that God wil save them through Christ, and yet they mistake Christ, and do not understand Christ aright: as thus, They trust in Gods Mercy through Christ, only to save them from danger, to save them from the punishment of their sin, meerly for such self-ends as they may be delivered from punishment; and they see no excellency in Christ but as he is one that should deliver them from punishment; this is presumption too. But when the soul is not only convinc'd of this, and sees this by the holy Spirit, that all the Mercy of God is to be conveyed through Jesus Christ. But then Secondly, The Lord shews to the soul the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of Christ, not only as one to deliver it from punishment, but as one in whom there is all good to make the soul happy for ever; there is Grace in Christ as wel as Pardon, there is Sanctification as wel as Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Glorification; there is the bringing in the soul to God, and union with God, and the enjoyment of God in Christ, and that's the happiness that my soul de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, not only to be delivered from Hell, but that I who was broken off from God through sin, may now come to have union with him, and so be happy in the enjoyment of God as my portion for ever; and thus I trust upon Gods grace in Christ: this is not presumption certainly. Though you could do this at such a time that you cannot find any ability in your selves to perform any duty, yet if you do now cast your selves upon the grace of God in Christ that you might have life in him, not only that you might have pardon, and to be delivered from Hell, but that you might have life; do this as soon as you wil, this is not presumption.</p>
                     <p>A Third thing wherein Presumption consists, is this, For men to beleeve that Christ is theirs, and that they shal be sav'd upon false grounds.</p>
                     <p>As thus, When men shall beleeve that Christ is theirs, and God wil have Mercy upon them, and save them, why? Because they are not so bad as others; because they do
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:118704:163"/> some good things, and they live honestly among men, and serve God as they speak, and because God blesses them in their outward estates, and they have prayed to him, and God hath heard them, and such things; and thus they beleeve that Mercy is theirs, and they shall be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and because good people think wel of them, and they keep company with them that are godly; here's presumption. Therefore when I exhort to beleeve in the want of Sence, I do not exhort to this, that you should presently conclude in your own hearts, well, Christ is mine, and I shal certainly be sav'd; no, but the work that I exhort to, it is, To cast your souls upon the grace of God in Christ for life, and for salvation; it may be you cannot have a reflect act upon your hearts, and say, I am sure I shall be sav'd; for to exhort men and women to this, that they should perswade themselves they shall be sav'd, that's not the thing, for that must be a work of Christs Spirit. But the first act of Faith wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the soul, though it doth not apprehend that it shal be sav'd, yet it wil venture its self upon the grace of God in Christ; and if I perish, I'le perish this way saith the soul: That's that which I exhort to, and not to make any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions that certainly I shal be sav'd upon such and such false grounds; no, if afterwards thou comest to make conclusions, it must be upon the testimony of the holy Spirit witnessing to thy soul, that this act of thine in ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting thy soul upon Christ, is a true act indeed, and not a meer delusion. For that may be the way of coming to have Sence, not that I shall know by certain effects that my Faith is true, not that only, though that's one way; but by the testimony of Gods Spirit witnessing this unto me, that this work of imne in thus going out of my self, and rouling my soul upon the grace of God in Christ, that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> is a true work, and not a delusion: It's true, where this witne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s of the holy Spirit is, it is ever according to the Word, and there wil follow gracious effects from it: But certainly there may come an assurance this way, &amp; may be
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:118704:163"/> as certain as I am certain that I see the light of the Sun by the light of the Sun; I need have no evidence that I see the light of the Sun but by the light of the Sun its self: And so there may be that certainly of the souls beleeving by the evidence of the work its self, by a work of enlightening by the Word; and this is another manner of ground of my joy, than because I am not so bad as others, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause God blesses me in my outward estate, and the like; no, I have found such a mighty work of God upon me, carrying me to his Son, and I do find now such an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Spirit that this is the work of God, so that I am become a new Creature, I am not only not so bad as other men, but I find a mighty change in me from death to life, I find I live by new Principles, and have a new Rule, and have new Ends that I propound to my self in all my waies: But this is after this work of Faith, from the effects of it. So that it is evident that your beleeving in the want of Sence is not Presumption, but the safest way that can be taken.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 The Third Motive is this, That it is the soonest way to get the sence of Gods Love.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> You wil say, <hi>Why? if I could find my self to be able to overcome my corruptions, and perform such and such duties as others are able to do, then I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded I should have the sence of Gods Love; but I think I shall never have it till then.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Thou goest the furthest way about; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ever God wil give it that way or no, it's a question: But if God should be so indulgent as to give it thee at last, yet it wil be a great while first, and thou wilt be held un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the spirit of Bondage a long time.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> You will say, <hi>We cannot do it in our selves.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> It's true; no more can you do any thing else; but let there be that power that you endeavor to put forth in other things, do you endeavor to put it forth here, and endeavor it in the first place (I speak to such
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:118704:164"/> as are sensible, that they have not the sence of Gods Love unto them, and are longing and thirsting after it.) that I confess: wil come among the Directions, but it's necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry here for the right understanding of what I mean: when I affirm, That it's the speediest way to get sence, for to labor to put forth an act of Faith even presently: Thou complainest of thy dead heart, and if it were more quick, thou shouldest then beleeve; let the assure thee, there's no such quickening grace as Faith is, <hi>The Just shall live by Faith;</hi> and the Scripture tels us, that the Lord hath quickned us; in <hi>Col. 2. 13. You being dead in your sins, and the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath be quickned together with him;</hi> How? <hi>Having forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven you all trespasses;</hi> so that the quickning of the heart you see it is in the work of Justification, it's in the forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of our trespasses: we first would fain have our hearts quickned, and then we would beleeve that our sins are for given us; no, but beleeving in the grace of God for Justification, that's the way of quickning; Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation doth follow after Justification, and therefore the soonest way to get grace; and what sence you would have in the Love and goodness of God, is by beleeving; that's the speediest way, you do but beat al out the bush in any other way: you wil get it abundantly sooner this way, in laboring to stir up acts of Faith, in beleeving in God, than you can do in any other way whatsoever. That may be done in some hear this way, that may not be done in some months or years in any other way.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 A Fourth Motive is this, Labor to stir up Faith, and to walk by Faith in the want of sence, because even when sence fails, then is the proper time for Faith to act, and then Faith doth appear in its own native excellency, in the proper colors or it.</p>
                     <p>As for Love (by comparing one Grace with another, we shal come to understand either Grace the better) for me to love another when I see all things lovely in them,
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:118704:164"/> and when there is nothing that any way discontents me, here doth not appear any great excellency in Love; who cannot but love such a one when there is al things lovely? But when you can love, even though there be cross dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions, though there be many things done that do dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please you, and unlovely, yet you can love, your love goes through a great many difficulties, and though there be much water, it cannot be quenched: Water will quench a little spark, but it cannot quench a great deal of fire; I, this Love is somwhat indeed. So it is here in Faith; It is not so much for a man to beleeve when he hath all kind of encouragements for his beleeving, when he hath sence to help him too, and experience, and all things goes according to what is spoken in the Word: But for me to beleeve though things seem to go quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to my Faith, though things be cross, here is the proper act of Faith, and the excellency of Faith: for me to be able to beleev against discouragements, as it was the commendations of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Faith to beleeve against hope, and above hope; whatsoever there is against my Faith, yet to beleeve: Certainly there were no great need of the Grace of Faith, if we had alwaies sence, if we had alwaies God in sight, and Heaven, and al the Glory that God hath laid up for his people; if there were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies this in our eye, then there were no great need of Faith; and therefore in Heaven such kind of Faith as this wil fail; the Scripture saith, that Faith and Hope wil cease, but Love continues; it's because that then they shal have alwaies sight: But when there is no sence, then appears the proper act of Faith, therefore labor in the want of Sence to put forth Faith.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 Fiftly, The beleeving in the want of sence, is a most glorious work in its self; there's a great deal of Glory in it. I remember three things that <hi>Luther</hi> speaks of, that are the hardest things to be done in the world; and one is, <hi>To beleeve things that seem to be impossible:</hi> And the
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:118704:165"/> other is, <hi>To trust in God, and beleeve in him, when he shews himself to be an Enemy:</hi> And the third, <hi>To hope in things that are defer'd:</hi> These are the hardest things to beleeve; Things impossible; To rely upon God, though he shews himself to be an Enemy; And to hope in things that are defer'd: but though they are very hard yet certainly they are glorious works of Faith. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Speech he hath; Faith if be strong, it doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg a God; what though God seems to leave the soul? yet then a strong Faith will acknowledg God a Receive of the soul at that time: And again saith he, When God doth seem to persecute a soul, yet it wil ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg God to be the helper of the soul at that very time; when God seems to damn a soul, he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges God to be a Savior to the soul at that very time: Here's the strength of Faith, and this is a glori us work of Faith, To acknowledg God that forsakes to be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver of the soul; God that seems to persecute, to be a Helper; God that damns, to be a Savior of the soul; here's a glorious act of Faith; and certainly it's glorious in the eyes of God, and in the eyes of his blessed Angels; it's such a glorious act, wherein the very Angels attain not too: There's no act that we read that the Angels have in Heaven greater than this, Though he kils me, yet wil I trust in him; that act of <hi>Job</hi> was a glorious act; the Scripture doth not mention any more glorious act of any of the Angels in Heaven than that act is; they have altogether sight, they see the face of God, and have no temptations to distrust in God; but in the midst of temptations, and when God seems to come out to kill a soul, yet then to rely upon his grace in Christ, here's a most gracious act of Faith.</p>
                     <p n="6">6 A Sixt Motive is this, As it's most glorious in its self; so it's that which honors God more than any other Grace: You know what the Scripture saith of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> he gave glory to God by beleeving: Why? would
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:118704:165"/> not you fain give glory to God in the greatest measure that possibly you can? If you would, it is by walking by Faith when God is out of sight, and when all things that might be otherwise encouragements seem to be out of sight. You give God here the glory not only of his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, and Goodness, and Mercy, but his Faithfulness: It's a notable Story that I remember <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> hath concerning <hi>Alexander,</hi> in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Plutarch</hi> in the life of <hi>Alex.</hi> fol 862.</note> to his Physitian <hi>Philip: Alexander</hi> had a Physitian which was named <hi>Philip,</hi> in whom he did much trust for his Faithfulness, whom one <hi>Permenio</hi> sought to defame to <hi>Alexander,</hi> and wrote unto him, that he was bribed and corrupted by <hi>Darius</hi> with large promises of great Riches to take away his life by giving of him poyson: some time after, such a Letter being brought to <hi>Alexander,</hi> he made none of his Familiars acquainted therewith: but that he might shew his confidence that he had in <hi>Philip,</hi> when the hour came that he should take his Medicine, <hi>Philip</hi> came into the Chamber, and brought a Cup in his hand with the Potion he should drink; <hi>Alexander</hi> then gave him the Letter, and withal cheerfully took the Cup of him, shewing no manner of fear or mistrust of any thing, and put it to his mouth, and drunk of the Potion before the Letter could be read: By the which he did, as if he should have said, See how you are accused, but yet for all that I am not afraid, but put confidence in your Faithfulness still. I would apply it thus: Did not <hi>Alexander</hi> honor his Physitian very much in this thing, in shewing to all the world how he durst trust him? And though he had such a temptation to suspect him, and to call him into question, yet he would hearken to no such temptation, but would venture his life upon him: It <hi>Alexander</hi> had given his Physitian never so much, it could not have been such an honor to him, as to shew how he would trust him in such a case as this: If we hear such and such an Accusation of such an one, yet if our hearts
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:118704:166"/> can trust in them, still it's a great honor that we put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. Now then consider what honor Faith puts upon God; it's true, our lives are in Gods hands: Saith Temptation and base Unbelief, God wil leave you one day, God intends no good to you, all that you have is but to prepare you for further wrath, you wil perish at last in such a way as this, God wil fail you at last: Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation would perswade us that God rather hated us in all that he doth, than intends love to us: When Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath said what it can, yea, when things do seem to works as if God would destroy us at last; saith Faith, but though he kill me, I will trust upon him, I will venture my Life upon him; yea, and I will ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture my life upon God in his waies; I am resolved whatsoever I suffer, and whatsoever I meet withal in those waies here, I'le lay down my life, and venture my Eternal Estate upon God in these waies of his: it may may be the world scorns me, and mocks me, and saith they are but Fancies and Conceits: But wel saith the soul, here I have pitcht my Anchor, and here I'le venture my Soul and Eternal Estate upon God in such waies as these are, although God doth seem to come against me as an Enemy; here's honor that we put upon God: Oh what honor is it to God when we so beleeve against sight: the Lord was so wel pleased with this work of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Faith, that be doth renew his Covenant with an Oath; he swears to him then what he wil do for him: Oh it did so take the heart of God that the Lord then took a solemn Oath that he would be his God, and the God of his Seed, Oh when the Lord sees a soul put such an honor upon his Faithfulness, then he doth not only promise, but swears to do good to that soul: As when men wil be tempting of God through unbeleef, the Lord swears against them, as against the people of Israel, the Lord is provoked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst unbeleef, when you wil tempt him that way; as they said, <hi>And can God prepare a table in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness? And there are the Children of</hi> Anach, <hi>and walls
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:118704:166"/> that reach to Heaven:</hi> Why? what are these the things that wil cause you to distrust in me, and be thinking of turning back again to Egypt? I swear in my wrath that you shall never enter into my rest, saith God: And so on the other side, when things seem to go quite contrary, and yet saith the soul, well, come what wil come, let me suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer never so much, I'le venture al, not only my Credit, and Liberty, and Comforts, I'le venture not only my present, but my eternal estate, and I'le lay my self at Gods feet: Now when the Lord sees this, Oh it's that which pleases him at the very heart, and he is ready to swear that this soul shal never miscarry: Oh it's a Grace that doth much honor God.</p>
                     <p n="7">7 And its a grace that doth argue very much Love to God: You say, Oh that you could love God more? those that beleeve most, they love most; as I hinted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Love is seen in this, that I wil not regard any accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations; the main work of Love is this, That it makes me that I can trust my self with my Beloved; as it is said of the good wife in the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> That the heart of her husband can trust in her; let any come and accuse his wife never so much, yet his heart can trust in her; strong Love cannot stand with Jealousies: Certainly where Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies are upon every little occasion ready to rise, it is from the want of Love; and so where there is a jealousie of God, there can be no hearty love.</p>
                     <p>So likewise about our listening to Accusations; If I do not love such and such, if any do accuse them to me, I can quickly hearken and entertain any accusation of them; but if I love them, I wil not entertain readily any accusations of them: As where there is several parties of men, and the Bond of Love is broken, let there be any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation against one that is in their way▪ they wil enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it; but let there come any accusations against men that are of the contrary party, they wil not so readily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain them: So, if we did love God, we would never entertain any ill reports of God: where the heart doth
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:118704:167"/> stand out against any ill reports of God, certainly the soul doth love God exceedingly.</p>
                     <p n="8">8 I'le give you one more Motive: Consider this, That Faith wheresoever it is, it is first wrought by an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty power in the soul; <hi>Ephes. 1. 18, 19. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding greatness of Gods Power whereby he raised up Christ from the dead, appears in the work of Faith:</hi> Consider this, If there he such an infinite power of God, the same power that raised Christ from the dead put forth in▪ Faith at first, then surely Faith is able to do great things: Thus I would reason; That thing that hath the choice of Gods Power, the excellency of the Power of God, the thing wherein the glory of Gods Power appears in above all other things, that thing hath a great deal of power put into it, and is able to do great things: But so it is with Faith, read over al the Book of God, and you never find such expressions of Gods Power for the doing of any thing that ever he did since the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, as in the 1. of the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> are expressions of his Power in working Faith in the soul: surely then one that hath any hope of having the work of God upon him, should argue thus, Hath God put forth such an Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Power in the working of this Grace in my soul, and shall this Grace be able to do nothing? If this Grace in my soul were only able to beleeve in God so long as I have God in sight, a little power would serve for this: but my Faith is a Grace that hath a great deal of Gods Power in it, and therefore God expects that there must be such things done by it as it may shew forth the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his Power. If God gives a man only Natural Parts, he would have them to be improved to the height of them: When God works Faith in the soul at first, saith God, I'le put forth a Power even beyond whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I put forth before, above all my Works that I have made: when I come to make a Beleever, and to work Faith in the soul, there shall be the choice and excellency of my Power: when this is done, saith God to the soul,
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:118704:167"/> Oh Beleever, now walk so as to manifest that which is done in your souls, wherein the excellency of my Power doth appear, and by doing so, we shall surely walk in a Gracious, and Holy, and Blessed way by Faith in the want of all Sence.</p>

                        <p>Motives to stir up weak Beleevers to the exercising of their Faith, when they want Sence. 1 Their Sence of Gods Love afterwards will be sweeter. 2 They be stronger against Temptations after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. 3 It will turn their greatest afflictions into the greatest Blessings. 4 To have jealousie of God for withdrawing, is tedious to his spirit.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>I Shall go on further in some few Motives for the stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring up of weak Beleevers in the exercising of their Faith.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Surely in the first place, The sight and sence that we shall come to have after our beleeving when there was no sight, will be so much the sweeter and more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable; a mercy that comes after Gods withdrawing of himself, and our exercising of Faith, is the sweetest mercy of any mercy; when a mercy is raised from the dead, as <hi>Isaac</hi> that was born against the apprehension of common Sence, and was a child of Faith, his name was called <hi>Isaac;</hi> now <hi>Isaac</hi> signifies <hi>Laughter,</hi> because <hi>Isaac</hi> was a matter of much Joy to his Parents: and so
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:118704:168"/> certainly whatsoever child it be that comes of Faith, is a child of Joy, whatsoever mercy comes upon the exercise of our Faith, and that when al things seem to work con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, that mercy, Oh 'tis a sweet mercy, it will pay for all the affliction that we had in the time of the want of Sence.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 If in the want of Sence, and the sight of Gods Love we can exercise Faith: That soul that can do so will be easily able to overcome almost any temptation after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards: If so be that thou canst so prevail by Faith up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thine heart to stand out in such an affliction as this is, when thou wantest the sight and sence of the Love of God, and yet thy Faith can work through this; if it can, it wil easily be able to overcome any temptation af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards: As suppose in any other business, a man hath not the success he desired and expected, but is crost in it, it may be upon this, temptation is very strong upon some, and they begin to be discouraged: But for one that hath been acquainted with any Spiritual dissertions, and yet their Faith hath wrought through them; such a one wil think surely, it is not so much for me to go on in my way, and to work through this discouragement, the want of success in such a business, as it was once for me to go on, and to work through that discouragement that I had, namely, in the want of the sight and sence of Gods Love; Faith helped me at that dead lift then, and why not now? and so for any other affliction: Let any affliction be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their bodies, or estates, in respect of their friends, of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that are neer to them, those afflictions are nothing in comparison of the want of the sight and sence of Gods Love in Christ: If the soul be but enabled here to work through this by Faith, it will find all afflictions to be but easie to him, therefore it is of great concernment for you to walk by Faith in the want of sence.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 By this means if we can exercise Faith in the want of Sence, we shall turn the greatest Afflictions into the greatest Blessings; of all afflictions that are in the world,
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:118704:168"/> the want of the sight and sence of Gods Love in Christ is the greatest affliction; but by the exercise of Faith we shall make this to be a blessing to us; we shal get abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of experience, and we shall come to have the Love of God more sweet unto us: and then having gotten through a difficulty as this is, we shall by it come to have more establishment a great deal in the constant way of our lives, and come to have more communion with God, and delight in God▪ and so we shall have a Blessing by that which is the greatest affliction of all.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 Fourthly and lastly, Consider what a tedious thing it must needs be to the Spirit of God, for a Saint upon Gods withdrawing himself, and the want of sight, presently to have jealous thoughts of God: As it would be tedious to any loving Husband, if he could never go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad upon any occasion, and be out of the presence of his Wife, but presently she were jealous; or if in the house he should find fault with any little thing, present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly she concludes her Husband loves her not, because his expressions are not so full, or his countenance so amiable at one time as at another; this would be very grievous to the spitit of a Husband to have such constructions to be made. Look how tedious it would be to the spirit of a Husband to have such ill constructions made by his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage or absence upon any necessary occasion; so tedious is it to the Spirit of God for a soul to be making such ill constructions upon Gods withdrawing himself, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he doth not alwaies manifest himself in the same way at one time, as at another: Oh let us take heed that we be not burdensom to the Spirit of God by our Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leef. There are many people that are partly afflicted by Melancholly and Unbeleef that are very tedious to the spirits of those they converse with; and as they are tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the Spirits of those with whom they do converse, so certainly their carriage is very tedious to the Spirit of God, they do grieve the Spirit of God by their Unbeleef, therefore let us take heed of our Unbeleef in the want of
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:118704:169"/> Sence, and labor to exercise Faith.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> I but you will say, <hi>What should we do? it's easie indeed to</hi> Tell <hi>us that we should exercise Faith in the want of sight and sence, but it is not so easie to</hi> Do <hi>it.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> I confess it is one of the hardest things in the world to exercise Faith in the want of Sence; therefore for help in this, take these Rules of Direction.</p>

                           <hi>Directions for the exercise of Faith in the want of Sence.</hi> First, <hi>Be afraid of Ʋnbeleef as much as of Presumption.</hi> Secondly, <hi>Listen not to any thing that makes against the Word.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>One Promise is enough to rest upon, though you think other Scriptures are against you.</hi> Fourthly, <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure up some Principles before temptation that you will stick to, As 1 There can be no conclusion of Reprobation, as of Election. 2 It is better to set upon Duties though we cannot do them as we ought, than omit them. 3 Where there is no peace with sin, there sin is not a sufficient ground to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the peace of the soul. 4 Where the soul com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains for the want of Grace, it cannot conclude against it self that it hath not that Grace. 5 There is a Faith of Adhaerence when there is none of Evidence.</hi>

                     </argument>
                     <head type="sub">DIRECTIONS.</head>
                     <p>FIrst, Be afraid of Unbeleef, as much as you are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of Presumption: If Beleevers, especially those that are weak, would be as much afraid of
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:118704:169"/> Unbeleef, as they are afraid of the sin of Presumption. You shall have many that are afraid to presume, but it scarce enters into their thoughts to be afraid of Unbeleef; if I presume, then that's dangerous, I may quickly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy my self that way: But why should you not be as much afraid to destroy your self by Unbeleef; there is not only destruction in Unbeleef as wel as in Presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but there is a wronging of the Grace of God in it, and so there may be more danger of sin in the one thing than in the other; it's true, there is sin &amp; danger in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption, and there is sin and danger in unbeleef too; and the truth is, that unbeleef is a more secret sin, and that which we may fall into before we are aware, sooner than the other: Now if the soul would but reason after this manner, It's true, I think that the Promises of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy belongs not unto me, and therfore I am afraid I should presume; but what if I should wrong the Grace of God! is not that a tender thing? and is there any thing in the world that God stands more upon to have honored than his Grace in Christ? and what if it should prove that I have wronged the Grace of God in Christ all this while, what a sad thing would it be! and would not that be as grievous to God as any thing else? Oh if you would but do thus, this would be a very great help to you; for there would be this Use of it, That it would make you to be willing to listen as well to those things that may further your believing in the in the grace of God in Christ that may ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor Gods Grace as to listen to those things that may take you off. We find by experience, That those that are weak, let one speak to them never so much by way of encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to Faith, they scarce listen to what is spoken, or doth not remember it; but whatsoever hints of any thing they have that any way may discourage them, that they mind, and their thoughts run after, and work upon, all that possibly they can: now it appears by this, that they are not afraid of the sin of Unbeleef so as of the sin of Presumption: Certainly next to that sin against the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:118704:170"/> Spirit, there is no greater sin in the world, than the sin of Unbeleef; and it is that which doth more cross the designs that God hath of honoring of himself, than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sin whatsoever; therefore be afraid of it, and charge thy heart with it, as thou woul'dst charge thy heart with that which thou art most inclinable to: If thou wert in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable to uncleanness, would'st not thou lay a charge upon thy heart to take heed of the least stirrings that way? If thou wert inclinable to worldline<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s, would'st not thou lay a charge upon thy heart against that? So charge thy heart to take heed of any beginnings of the sin of Unbeleef, because that's the sin that thou art most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable to. If thou wert impatient, wouldest not thou be careful to charge thy heart to take heed of that sin? Charge thy heart to take heed of this sin of Unbeleef. That's the first Rule.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The Second Rule of Direction is this, At any time when thou hast a word that doth but seem to make for thee, take heed that thou doest not hearken to any thing against that word, but require a proof for it out of the Word; as thus, If thou hast any thing in Gods Word that is presented to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e, in any way for the hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of thy Faith in the want of Sence, never listen to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing that makes against that word, but require a proof for it out of the Word: many times when we have a word that speaks well, and encouraging our Faith, we set many times our own fancies, and conceits, and surmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and jealousies, and fears against the Word, and this doth us much harm: But when we have a word we should never listen to surmises, nor jealousies, and fears; but here's a Word, and can I have as much out of the Word against me in such a thing, as I have here in the Word to encourage me? doth the Word beat me off as well as encourage me in this way? If indeed I can bring out of the Word, that they that are thus and thus, have no Grace, that such and such things as these are, cannot
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:118704:170"/> stand with true Grace; if I can prove this out of the Word, then it is somwhat. Where have you almost a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man or woman that comes with any Objections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their estates and conditions, with any of their doubts, that bring any Word for to strengthen their doubts withal? Indeed their doubts that are in them, seem to be very strong, and prevail much to discourage their hearts; but is it from the Word that their doubts are strengthened? You shall seldom hear them to bring any text of Scripture for their doubts; only they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid, and was ever any of Gods People so as they are? But they come not thus, and say, Sir, Here's such a place of Scripture that I read such a day, and me thinks this Scripture makes against me. If you would go no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the Scripture for your doubts, it were an easie matter to help to answer them, for then we could shew you what God intends in that Scripture, but it's almost impossible to answer jealousies, and fears; we could an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer ten Scriptures sooner than one jealousie and fear, that hath no ground from Scripture: Give me but a Scripture for your doubts, I can give you another that may be for your encouragement; as that Scripture where Christ saith, <hi>He that comes unto me, I will in no wise cast off;</hi> the Scripture requires nothing but coming to him; and then, <hi>Ho, every one that thirsteth, come and buy without money, and take the Waters of the Well of Life freely:</hi> these Scriptures, we can plainly shew you the meaning of the Spirit of God in them for encouragement; but can you shew such Scriptures as any of your doubts are grounded upon? Many of you have many doubts concerning your Sanctification; but have you any text that tels you, that where Sanctification is not perfect, that there the soul hath no interest in Christ? Therefore this may encourage any soul to come in and beleeve, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there are no such Scriptures as doth tell any, That because they have not perfection in Sanctification, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there are remainders of corruption in them, that
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:118704:171"/> therefore they have no interest in God and Christ. If we would take no comfort but from Scripture, and we would listen to no Objections but from Scripture, then it were an easie matter to get Faith to be exercised, and we should walk by Faith more than we do, if we would rest upon the Word, both for the ground of our encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, and for our doubtings, so as to resolve the Word shall be as much the ground of my doubts and fears, as it shal be the ground of my Faith and Comforts: Do but hold to this, and then you wil be mightily helped to walk by Faith, and not by sight; for though sight fails us, yet the Word never doth fail, but abides the same; a sure and an everlasting Foundation.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, If you have any one sign that may encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage you, you may take comfort from that though you find not another; If upon the searching in the Book of God, you find any one Promise making for you, though you may think other things are against you, that one is enough for you to rest your souls upon; for where there is one, though you are not able to apprehend the other, yet there are others too: For that's a certain Rule, Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Promise doth hold forth Christ; and where there is any one Grace, there's all Grace, though it cannot be seen: As a man may know as certainly a wicked man by the living in any one known sin, and by his heart closing with it; though he doth not live in others; yet there is no sin mortified in that man that hath any one sin reigi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ing in him; that is, if he hath any one sin that he knows to be a sin, and yet his heart closes with it, and is not set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it as an Enemy to him, this man hath not any sin mortified: so, where there is any one Grace, there is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Grace, though it cannot be seen. If I should come to one that is carnal, and if I see but the sin of Covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, of Ear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>hlyness, of Worldlyness in him, if I should charge him, and say, that you are an unclean person too; he would defie it, he thinks himself far from it, Why?
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:118704:171"/> Because he doth not commit the act of it: but that's certain, where thou art under the power of any one sin, there's no sin mortified: So, where any child of God can but find the work of any one Grace; it may be such a one will say, I can find no work of other Graces, but I bless God, there is some Grace I can find; as for instance, this Grace, That I love the Saints, I love the Brethren, and I love them because they are Godly, and upon no other ground; and I find I love the Word, and the more holy the Word is, the more do I love it: If there be but this one Particular, though thou canst not find the exercise of other Graces, yet thou mayest certainly conclude there are all Graces: All Graces are in that soul where there is any one Grace: this would be a mighty help to Faith in the want of Sence. When you come to examine your heart, it may be the Devil wil be putting you upon those Graces that are the weakest of all, and are most opposed by your corruptions, and will be ready to tell you, that you have no Grace because you have not that Grace: but is there any other grace that you have? If you can find in your souls there is any grace, certainly you may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that you have an interest in God and his Love, though he be out of sight.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, A Fourth Rule of Direction to walk by Faith in the want of sight, is this, Labor to treasure up some Principles, or some certain Conclusions and Truths that you will stick too, and resolve upon whatsoever temptations comes against them: As for Instance thus:</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Here's one Principle which is as cleer as any thing in the world, and that I can easily convince any man of, that is not in a temptation; but if you be not satisfied in it before a temptation comes, you wil not be so soon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd of it when it is come; as this one Truth, That there is no threat in the Word of God that is absolute, so as that it may not be recall'd: Or rather take it thus;
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:118704:172"/> There is no certain sign in the Word of God whereby any one can conclude themselves to be a Reprobate: Observe now the difference of Gods grace, how Gods grace is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond his wrath and displeasure in this, in the manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it: Promises of mercy you have absolute, but the threats of Gods wrath, you have none but conditional; yea, and so conditional as may be recal'd again: And signs of Election you have certain, whereby we may know our Election; but signs of Reprobation, whereby any man or woman while they live should conclude themselves to be Reprobates, there's none in all the Book of God, only that of the sin against the holy Spirit, which is a sin that such a soul that is making after God, and lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging after the light of his face, is far enough from: Oh the grace of God in this for to help against unbeleef, and help our Faith; That God should be pleased for to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest his Election certain, in the Word, <hi>We know your Election,</hi> saith the Apostle; he speaks of the Election of others, <hi>For our Gospel came to you, not in word only, but in power:</hi> but there is no certain tie of Reprobation, <hi>Those whom he hath predestinated, he hath called:</hi> we know by our calling, our predestination, but we cannot conclude our selves to be Reprobates; I confess there are some signs that are dangerous ones; that is, Such as may make men fear, yea, and conclude too, That if they should live and die in such a condition, then they were Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates, that's certain: and some are more black brands than others of Reprobation, As the turning of the grace of God into wantonness, that's one of the blackest brands of Reprobation of any; or for God to suffer a man to prosper in a wicked course; but yet these are not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain: Though a soul doth turn the grace of God into wantonness, yet who knows but that God may convince that soul? Lay this as a Principle, That there can be no conclusion of any one, excepting that which I touched on before, no concluding that they are Reprobates: And whatsoever threatnings there are in the Word, they
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:118704:172"/> are not so absolute, but there is a way that God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds in the Word, a way for my, and for thy soul, to deliver my self, or thee to deliver thy self from the strength and power of those threatnings; that is, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving, and by repenting: This is easie for men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to beleeve; but in time of temptation, it is not so easie to beleeve this.</p>
                     <p>Oh lay this for a conclusion, let my condition be the worst that possibly can be imagined, let me lay up this son a Conclusion, There is no threat that is absolute, but the soul while it lives may be delivered from it.</p>
                     <p>And I hear this, That there is no Condition so sad that is a certain sign of a Reprobate: There can be no Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of Reprobation as of Election.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Another Principle is this, That it is better for to set upon those things that God requires of us though we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do them as we ought, than wholly to omit them: You will find this an extraordinary help; I know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing a greater hinderance to the work of Faith in the soul than this; for those that are enquiring after God and his Waies, because they cannot do Duties as they ought, or cannot get that good that they do desire, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they think that they were better to let all alone: and Temptations work strongly that way, and if temptations can prevail over the heart in this thing, it hath yet enough to keep the soul under a spirit of bondage, and unbeleef alwaies: But if this be a conclusion laid, that I had better be doing what God would have me, and using the means that God requires, than let them alone; it were better to be doing, though I cannot do as I ought: As somtimes I have said of Water that doth run through a pipe, though it keep nothing in, yet it keeps the pipe sweet; so though you cannot remember any thing of the Word, but it runs through your memory, yet it keeps you from being mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, or from gathering filth: I come to a Sermon, indeed I cannot say I have gotten much by it; but thus far; if thou neglect the Word, thy hear will grow more corrupt a
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:118704:173"/> great deal than if thou comest to the Word: And so, a man that is sick in his stomach, it may be he eats som meat, but his stomach casts it al up again; you will say, were not this man as good eat no meat at al? yet you wil give him meat for al that, for there is somthing that is turned to nourishment that doth uphold the life of the man: And so 'tis in the use of means, though we think that all the means are lost, yet there is somthing insensibly that doth work; and however, thou art in the way that God would have thee to be in; and if there were nothing else but this, this were enough: Lay this for a Principle, and it will be advantagious in the time of dissertion.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Another Principle is this, That where there is no peace with sin, there sin is not a sufficient ground to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the peace of the soul: I mean by that <hi>No peace with sin,</hi> not only that our consciences are against our sins, but that our hearts, our wills and affections are against them as well as our consciences; for I confess the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of a wicked man may be against his sin though his sin doth close with his will and affections; but where there is a fight against sin by the will and affections, that soul feels sin to have a contrariety to the disposition of the heart, there is a contrary temper and disposition in the heart to sin; there the remainder of sin is not a sufficient ground to hinder the peace of the soul: There may be a great deal of corruption in the soul, but while it is as a disease, and not mingled in the very temperature of the soul, there it is not a sufficient ground to hinder the peace of the soul.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 A Fourth Principle is this, That where the soul finds the want of any Grace, or at least sensible that it cannot be sensible as it would be, and doth hunger after that grace, and prize it above all comforts in this world, and that for the excellency there is in it, there the soul cannot conclude against its self, that it hath not that grace in it, it is too much boldness for the soul to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:118704:173"/> against its self that it hath not that grace in it, it is too much boldness for the soul to conclude, God hath ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver wrought such a grace in me; if so be that I find, that because I have not the sence of that Grace, and the work of it as I desire, that this is the burden of my soul, it is that which is the grief of my heart, that I do want the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of such a grace, and the Lord knows how I would prize it, not only because it is necessary, I cannot be sav'd without it; but how I would prize it as that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there is an Excellency, a Beauty, a Glory, and this is that which my soul longs for, and I am making after with all my might; such a soul cannot conclude, That that Grace is not wrought within it. Oh this would answer an hundred Doubts, and Queries, and Objections of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny people in the time of the affliction of their consciences about Graces, that will thus conclude, Well, Certainly there's such and such a Grace that I have not, and because I have not that, I am afraid I have none at all: But if this be put to thee, Is not this the burden of thy soul that thou wantest such and such Graces as these are? and dost thou not prize the happy condition of those that have them? and is not thy soul in a way of hungring and thirsting after that Grace, and laboring for it? Thou shalt speak against the grace and the goodness of God to thee, if thou shouldest conclude that thou hast not this Grace already; it may be in thee, and under the Clods, though perhaps thou dost not see it so cleerly in the fruit and effects of it.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 A Fift Conclusion is this, That there is a Faith of Adhaerence where there is not a Faith of Evidence, lay up that; take the expression thus, There may be union with Christ, where there is no vision: It is no argument, because I have no vision, therefore I have no union; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it an argument, because I have not Faith of Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, therfore I have no Faith of Adhaerence; a soul may truly and safely stick and cleave unto God, unto Christ, by a faith of Adhaerence, though it have no Faith of Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:118704:174"/> to it self for the present: this is helpful to the soul to help it in beleeving in the want of sence, when God is out of sight. If the soul hath not that Faith of Evidence that it doth desire, for it then to conclude it hath no faith at all, thou mayest have a Faith of Adhaerence, and thou shouldest try whether thou doest not find thy heart to cleave to Jesus Christ, and to close with him. Now these Principles are to be laid beforehand, and there is no man that is out of a temptation, but wil acknowledg these things.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>A Fifth Direction for the exercise of Faith in want of Sence; which is, When Reasoning and Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations wax strong, the way is not to answer them, but to pray. <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Set before thee, the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace. <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Act Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance afresh.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>FIfthly, Another Direction in the want of Sence, is this; That when Reasonings and Temptations grow strong, the way is not to answer them with Reasonings, and to seek to satisfie those temptations; but rather to fall to prayer, and to spread them before the Lord, as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> did <hi>Rabshekes</hi> rayling Letter: the Devil comes somtimes, and even rails upon God, and his Truths, and Waies, and Saints, but do thou go and spread them before the Lord, do not think to answer Reasoning with Reasoning, the Devil will be too hard; if thou beginnest to Reason with Flesh and Blood, and thinkest to satisfie thy self by thine own Reasonings, the Devil will be too
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:118704:174"/> hard, he is too cunning a Logitian for thee; we must not sight with the Devil in his own way, that is, by Reason, for the Devils have stronger Parts and Reasons than we can have, if we rest to our own Understanding: But the way is to fly to Jesus Christ, to beseech him that he would answer these Reasonings and Temptations: Oh when a soul can in the quietness of it commit its self to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, and spread its case before him, Lord, I am put to a non-plus here, I know not what to say to my self, and my condition, only I think that I can say this, That I love thee, as you know when Christ spake to <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Lovest thou me? Lord, thou knowest that I love thee:</hi> It may be Temptation comes and saith, If you lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved God, you would do thus and thus, and surely these and these things cannot stand with a true Love to God: it may be thou canst not answer every particular, but canst thou go in the quiet of thy heart, and appeal to God, Lord, thou knowest that I love thee, I know not what to say to these things that are suggested; but Lord, thou knowest that I love thee? Indeed if a man should come and bring some Evidences to you, and Reasons to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince you, that your heart is naught, and your waies are evil; it's not enough for you to stand out and say, well, say what you will, yet I beleeve that my condition is good, and it's not so bad as you will make it; it's not for you to answer men so, but when there comes a temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Devil, you are not bound to give the Devil an accompt, as you are to give your Brother an accompt: If you can go into the presence of God, and appeal to God that your waies are right, and that God knows you love him, that may be an answer to a thousand temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that comes into your minds: And if you can open your hearts freely in Prayer, and look up to Jesus Christ your great Champion, and desire his help to assist you in this Combate: this is a better way than to think to stand out with Reasoning and wrastling with temptation: Oh rather, rather appeal to God in Prayer, and open your
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:118704:175"/> hearts to him, and that's the way. <hi>Luther</hi> used to say, <hi>That his Peayers were the Leeches of his Cares;</hi> as Leeches will suck out corrupt blood, so Prayers will get out the strength of temptations: Many Physitians in some cases will rather seek to purge the Body that way than by giving a Potion; the Leeches sucking out cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt blood will sooner clense the Body than a Potion: And so the Leeches of Prayer will many times sooner help against a temptation than any other thing that can be done.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly: Further, In the time of Dissertion, the Direction that we should take, is this; Labor to keep in thine eye, the Object of Faith: So as to behold and look upon that which may help thy Faith, set before thee, the Covenant of Grace, the Freeness, the Fulness of Gods Grace in Christ as 'tis revealed in the Covenant, the plentiful Mercy that is there, keep that in thine eye: Many when they want the sight of Gods Favor, they then are altogether poring upon their corruptions, looking upon the black side of the cloud; but though you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not apprehend yet, that God is yours, and the Favor and Love of God in Christ, yet you may keep in your eye those things that are the Object of the Faith of such as are true Beleevers; what is it that raises the Faith of Beleevers, but the presenting of the Glory and Riches of the Covenant of Grace to them? Now do not you turn away your eyes from it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> You will say, <hi>But I know not whether it belongs to me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Yet look upon it, keep your eyes upon it, upon some special part of the Gospel, some remarkable Scriptures as have most of the Gospel in them, as that, <hi>So God loved the world, that he sent forth his only begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Son, &amp;c.</hi> and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 19. And such Scriptures that hold forth much of the Gospel should be kept in your eyes, meditate on them, roul them in your thoughts and you know not what they may work.</p>
                     <pb n="411" facs="tcp:118704:175"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> You will say, <hi>These things do belong to Beleevers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Nay, They do not belong only to those that are actual Beleevers already; but they are to that end reveal'd, that they might work Faith where it is not: they have a generative faculty in them, it is through the Gospel that Faith is begotten, as wel as encreased; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore keep those things in your eye for the raising of your Faith: And that's another help in the want of Sence.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, I shall give you one more, and that is, In the want of Sence and Sight, let it be you great care if you think you have not had Faith and Repentance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, yet now afresh to act it: That's likewise a Rule that upon any occasion in speaking to those in Disserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I ever make use of, and shall ever as a special Rule as any I know for to help those that are in any spiritual Dissertions, to renew an act of Faith and Repentance, yea, if they think they never beleeved before, yet to strive to put forth a work of Faith and Repentance; that is thus, It may be the soul hath examined and searched to know what the condition is between God and it, and can find no evidence at all that ever it had any grace, yet what hinders but that you may now beleeve? do not spend so much time to look over your old Evidences, to find out your Evidences that were of ancient date, as forthwith to strive to put forth a new act of Faith: If thou beest non-plust with the temptations of the Devil, or thine own heart, that thou knowest not what in the world to say; but answer thus, Well, grant the worst that may be, Suppose al that hath been before were false, yet what hinders, but that <hi>now</hi> I may beleeve? Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber what hath been said, There is nothing that gives right to Christ but beleeving, and nothing gives any man right to beleeve, but beleeving, therefore what hinders but that at this instant I may beleeve? I do not mean this by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving, to conclude that my condition is good, for many Christians are held under the Spirit of bondage
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:118704:176"/> by this, they think the Nature of Faith is this, For to conclude in their own thoughts, that their condition is good, and that they certainly shall be saved; that's a fruit of Faith, but not the Nature of Faith: The Nature of Faith is the rouling of the soul upon the free Grace of God in Christ. Now though there be many things that may hinder me from concluding that my state is good, yet there is nothing that should hinder me from rouling my soul upon the free Grace of God in Christ: A man hath some hope that he hath such an Acquittance, or a Bond among some Papers in his Boxes, but he cannot find it; if he hath to deal with one that's Faithful, he may go likely, and get his Bond renewed, or get an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quittance made anew before he can find his old one▪ So 'tis here, we having to deal with a Faithful God, when many times we have lost our Evidences, lost our bonds; the way is to go and renew our Acquittances, to renew our Bonds, to renew our Evidences; that is, to go and exercise Faith afresh; what hinders me that now this very morning or evening, but that I may put forth an act of Faith upon Jesus Christ.</p>
                     <p>I shall conclude with this one Note: I affirmed to you before, that there was a Faith of Adhaerence, where there is not a Faith of Evidence; let me now tell you, That there is a Venturing Faith, as well as of Adhaerence and Evidence: Indeed this Venturing Faith is an Adhae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, but when the soul cannot have encouragement to beleeve under the notion of Adhaering to Jesus Christ, it may be the violence of temptation seems to drive it off from Adhaering: But for the helping of those that are under temptation, and want Sence altogether, let Faith be presented under the Notion of Venturing; though we have not the word in Scripture, yet we have the thing, as that of the poor woman of <hi>Canaan,</hi> though she were put off, and call'd a Dog, and the like, yet <hi>Dogs have crum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="413" facs="tcp:118704:176"/> And so when the foul can but come to this, Well, it's true, I am out-reasoned by temptation, and I know not what in the world to say to my self what my condition is, I see I am puzled, and I am never like to work, out this temptation in that way of Reasoning I am in; but for my part, I am resolved upon this, If the Lord destroy me, he shall destroy me relying upon him; it's true, I do not know yet whether God will receive me or no, I have not that Evidence, and for my cleaving to the grace of God in Christ, whether I can do it o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>oul upon the Grace of God in Christ; this shall be my way: I am sure, if I depart from God, I must perish, if I should be weary of God and his Waies, and forsake them, and imbrace mine own sinful waies, I am certain that I shall perish there; but I'le rather do this, I will venture my soul here, and here I will lie as a poor, wretched, miserable Creature in my self, and I will cast an eye up towards his Holy Temple, towards the Grace of God, and here my soul shall pitch and venture, I'le cast Anchor here, whether the Tempest will be so great that it will break Anchor and Cable I know not, but I am sure if I do not cast Anchor, I shall run upon the Rocks and split, and suffer Ship-wrack.</p>
                     <p>I confess were not the soul in a temptation, this were not enough, meerly to venture, we must not rest in this, we must stil be laboring to find that our souls do adhaere, and cleave to the Grace of God in Christ, and never be at quiet till we have got some assurance of it too. But I declare what is to be done in the time of temptation; when a man is in a storm and tempest, then it is a work acceptable to God, and it hath had very often excceeding good success; when a soul not knowing what to do, yet at length it hath concluded thus, If I am undone I will be undone in Christs arms, and here I will hang, and ride at this Anchor, and if the Lord should shake me into Hell, yet I'le hang as long as I can, and here I'le venture:
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:118704:177"/> Oh this will keep thee from departing from God, and wil be such an acceptable work to God as it's like that thou shalt not be long without some manifestation of God to thee to encourage thee in thy way: and for to make all the former good, I'le leave this one thing with you, and that's this; Know, that all times are not fit times for you to judg of your condition in; it's not a fit time to judg whether a Tree be alive or dead in the midst of Winter; 'tis not a fit time to weigh Gold when I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad in a tempest and storm; 'tis not a fit time to judg of the Constitution of ones Body in the Fit of a Feaver; and of the comliness of ones Countenance in the time of an Ague; no, if you would judg of the Body, you must do it when it is in health; and so if you would weigh Gold, it must be when the Scales may stand even: There are many poor weak Beleevers that did never pass any judgment upon themselves, but in the hour of a Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is the unfittest time; no, rather stay while you are your self, and then you may be fitter to judg of your estate.</p>
                     <p>These Directions may be some good help for your Faith in the want of Sence, that while God withdraws himself, yet you may be able in some measure through the Lords assistance to walk by Faith, when you cannot walk by sight.</p>

<pb n="416" facs="tcp:118704:178"/> Faith hath been exercised; If you perform any Duty, look back, I have done what God requires of me, but how have I done it? how hath my soul closed with the free Grace of God in Christ after I have done all that I can? yet have I been beat down in mine own thoughts, and advanced free Grace? have I found my soul acting upon the Promise at this time, when I have been Praying, and Hearing, and Receiving? These thoughts are but seldom in the hearts of many Christians, they look at rather the performing of a Duty in a Moral way, than in a true Christian and Evangelical way. I shall proceed to some further Cases about the walking by Faith: And they may be referr'd to these Two Heads.</p>
                     <p>First, Either, How a Christian should walk by Faith in time of Affliction. Or,</p>
                     <p>Secondly, How he should walk by Faith when God cals him to any difficult Service.</p>
                     <p>When God laies any affliction upon us, yet it is not Sence that we give way to, but it is Faith that we act in our afflictions.</p>
                     <p>And then when God cals me to any work, though at the first I may think it is beyond me, I shall never be able to accomplish it, yet in this difficult work I am to walk by Faith, and act Faith, and if any thing will carry me through, it is Faith.</p>
                     <p>First for Afflictions, they are of two sorts: Either Inward, or Outward Afflictions.</p>
                     <p>Even that which we have treated about already, The want of the sight of God, is a great inward affliction, and we might bring it under this Head: yet there are some inward afflictions that are beyond this, Not only that God withdraws himself from the soul, and there is the want of sight; but what if God comes against the soul as an Enemy? that's beyond Gods withdrawing of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, so that there is no sight of him: and yet even then a Saint should walk by Faith; not only when God is withdrawn, but when God shall appear as an Enemy;
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:118704:178"/> for many souls are ready to say, The Lord hath done so to me.</p>
                     <p>As to the Help of that, when God appears as an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to the soul: Know,</p>
                     <p n="1">1 First for your help that you may not despond, and Faith may not be shattered, That this is not such a condition, but others of the dear Saints of God have been put into heretofore: 'tis some encouragement for the act of Faith, when I know that my condition is not such but that others of the dearest Saints of God have been in that condition, and yet in that condition, they did walk by Faith, and so got out of it: In <hi>Job,</hi> 13. 24. see there what the complaint of that holy man was, <hi>Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and holdest me for thine Enemy?</hi> here you have both these: The want of sight, yea, here is a degree beyond that, Thou hidest thy face, <hi>and hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest me for thine Enemy:</hi> God appeared so against him even as an Enemy; it was not in regard of his outward afflictions and losses that he look'd at so much; but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of Spiritual afflictions that were upon his soul, God did tear and rend him even as an Enemy: and so many others of Gods Servants; <hi>Heman</hi> in the 88. <hi>Psalm:</hi> If you read that Psalm, you shal find that surely it was no less that God did appear to him, but as an Enemy.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 But for our further help, Know, It may be that these are but the dark apprehensions of Unbeleef, and not indeed that God really is as an Enemy to you: It was certainly the unbeleef of the people of Israel which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed them to say, when they were brought into straights, <hi>God hath brought us into the Wilderness because he</hi> HATED <hi>us;</hi> presently concluding that God was an Enemy, because they had not what they would have; and that's the vain froward disposition of some, if they cannot have what they would have, it is because God hates them: This is thy Unbeleef that thou art to check thy self for.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 But suppose there were a reallity in it, That God
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:118704:179"/> did appear indeed as an Enemy, certainly the best way is not to fly from him; though he hath the Sword of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice in his hand ready to strike thee, yet the best way, it is to come and crouch before him, to lie down in his presence, to put thy neck even to the stroke of Justice, and to exercise a Venturing Faith: howsoever fly not from him though he doth appear as an Enemy, for there can be nothing got in flying from him.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 Yea but Fourthly, If thy soul be at enmity with sin, certainly God is not thine Enemy whatsoever he doth appear to thee: though he seem to come in never such a terrible manner against thee, yet if thou canst but look into thy heart, and see whether there be, not only in thy conscience, but in thy very heart, contrary Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples unto it: God is never an Enemy to that soul that is an Enemy unto sin.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 And yet further, in the fifth place; Suppose there were a reallity that God were an Enemy, yet know, there is enough in Christ to reconcile Enemies, in <hi>Rom. 5. 10. For if when we were Enemies, we were reconciled to God:</hi> even when we were Enemies; therfore though thou beest an Enemy, and though God appears to thee as an Enemy, yet when we were Enemies, we were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to God: Thou mayest then act Faith upon the purchase of the Blood of Christ, though thou apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest thy self as an Enemy, and God coming as an Enemy against thee.</p>
                     <p n="6">6 And yet further, It may be it is because thy heart is loose, and careless, and negligent in thy way, that ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God doth seem to come against thee as an Enemy, as he did against <hi>Moses;</hi> you know the Lord came in a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible manner against <hi>Moses</hi> to stay him in the Inn; sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then he came in the appearance of an Enemy: but it was because <hi>Moses</hi> had been negligent of the circumcising of the Child. Thou art to search and examine thy way, what negligence, and loosness, and wantonne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s, and dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is in thy heart, what sluggishness is in thy heart;
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:118704:179"/> why? God doth but draw his Sword to awaken thee, and to stir thee up, and do but thou do as those that <hi>Joab</hi> came against, <hi>Send the head of</hi> Shimei <hi>the son of</hi> Bicr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>and we are gone:</hi> so do thou renounce thy sin, and God will appear no more as an Enemy.</p>
                     <p n="7">7 Moreover: Yet still let Gods appearance be never so terrible, it's fit for thee to trust in him, and to say with <hi>Job, Though he kills me, yet will I trust in him:</hi> Suppose he doth intend to destroy me, but yet if I be destroyed, I will trust with my heart making towards him, my heart shall rely upon him even while he is stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the fatal blow upon me: Faith is able to see Love through frowns; though God seem'd to be never so an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with <hi>David,</hi> yet <hi>Cast me not out of thy presence.</hi> It is a Speech of <hi>Luther,</hi> speaking in the commendations of Faith, That's one great commendation for a man to love God when God shews himself an Enemy; and that is the excellency of Faith to enable the soul to do that. These Meditations may be some help to the exercise of Faith, and walking by it in such a condition.</p>
                     <p>But God lets out Satan upon me in great, and sore, and strong temptations; and would he let out the Devil up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me so as he doth, if he lov'd me? but shall I be able to walk by Faith, when I am hurried by the temptations of the Devil? That's a sore and a great affliction that the Saints endure. As for that, still you must know that it hath been the portion of the dear Saints of God to have Satan let out upon them too: we shall find that God saith to Satan, that he had given <hi>Job</hi> into his hand, and Satan was let out upon him, and that in a fearful manner: we reade in <hi>Luke,</hi> of a daughter of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and yet she had been bound by Satan for eighteen yeers toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Satan doth prevail many times very much upon the dear Children of God: <hi>Paul</hi> had a prick in the flesh, a messenger of Satan that was sent to buffet him: And <hi>Luther</hi> often complains of most horrid temptations of Satan, and makes all the outward afflictions that he
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:118704:180"/> endured, and enmity, and rage of all the Popish party to be nothing to those inward afflictions that he had in his Spirit: I remember that upon it he saith, that there are Three things make a Divine, <hi>Reading, Meditation,</hi> and <hi>Temptation;</hi> In Meditation he includes Prayer, which the Scripture cals the Meditation of the heart: these make a Divine, and God did prepare him for great Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices that he intended for him by his temptations upon him.</p>

                        <p>Encouragement for a Saint at that time when God lets the Devil out upon him. 1 The Devil was more upon thee, when thou wert less sensible of him. 2 God hath good ends in it. 3 Consider that Christ himself was tempted, for two Ends: <hi>First,</hi> That he might be a merciful High-Priest. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That he might take out the venom of temptation. 4 Consider Christ prayeth for the tempted. 5 Christ hath broke the Serpents head. 6 Consider the Promises that temptation shall not prevail. 7 Think not to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Satan by Reason. 8 The power of sin is a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter evil than the strongest temptation. 9 Walk by Faith in the stirrings of corruptions.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>KNow therefore further for the help of thy Faith in this: Let not thy heart despond; though the Lord let out the Devil upon thee, yet walk by Faith in that condition: For,</p>
                     <p n="1">1 First, At such a time when thou wert not appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive nor sensible of Satan, then he was worse upon thee, than he is now, though thou hadst not those horrid
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:118704:180"/> temptations that now thou hast, yet he had more power over thee then, than now; and therefore thou hast no cause to be discouraged in this.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Lay this up as a help of thy Faith, That God hath very good ends why he doth exercise his dearest Servants even with such a heavy affliction as this is, The strong temptations of Satan: Satan in this case is like unto the Shepheards Dog; the Shepheard sets his Dog to worry the Sheep a little, but it is to bring the sheep in, and not to kill them, for he cals it off when he pleases: So Satan is as it were the Dog that God, the great Shepheard, doth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>end somtimes to worry the Sheep, but so as he cals him off when he pleases, it is but to bring those that are wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring out into the Fold: And as tempests and storms cleer the Air, even so hideous and terrible temptations will cleer the soul; the soul comes to cleer up after them, you come to know your hearts a great deal better than before.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Further, Know that Christ himself was tempted: If you read but the story of Christs temptations in the 4. of <hi>Matthew,</hi> it is a story of excellent use, and a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty encouragement for the exercise of Faith in the time of Temptation. Even the Lord Jesus Christ the Son of God did not escape it, but the Devil had so much power even to carry his Body up and down, and to set it upon the Pinacle of the Temple, and tempt him to as hideous things as you are tempted too: he tempted him even to the greatest Idolatry that ever was, To fall down and worship him; to the most fearful Blasphemy, To cast off God his Father, and to acknowledg even the Devil himself to be a god unto him. All these were from these Two Ends: Either,</p>
                     <p>First, That Christ might be a merciful High-Priest: as that he might be sensible of your temptations, he being tempted so himself; Christ knows what it is to be tempted by the Devil, therefore in <hi>Heb. 4. 13. We have
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:118704:181"/> not an High-Priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our Infirmities, but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin:</hi> it's true, the temptation did not prevail in him to sin, yet he was tempted likewise in all things; there's no temptation more hideous and blasphemous that Satan doth tempt us withal, than he tempted Christ himself; and this was, That he might be a merciful High-Priest, and that he might be touched with our Infirmities.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Yea, and not only so, but you are to look upon the Temptations of Satan as part of his Humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, part of his Sufferings that is meritorious, as that which takes out the sting and evil of all temptations; the venom of the temptation is taken out by Christs being willing to subject himself unto temptations; as the sting and venom of death, is taken out by Christs subjecting himself unto death; so the sting and venom of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions is taken out by Christs subjecting himself unto them.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 And yet further, We find that Christ prayes for his People; that they may not be overcome with tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: Thou must walk by Faith in the time of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that is, not only act thy Faith upon Christs temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, for to take out the sting and venom of it, but act thy Faith upon Christs Prayer: That Prayer that Christ prayed for <hi>Peter,</hi> surely he made it for you too; you may as well apply that Prayer for <hi>Peter,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> in the <hi>Hebrews</hi> applies the Promise that was made to <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shua:</hi> In <hi>Luke,</hi> 22. 31, 32. Christ tels <hi>Peter</hi> that Satan had desire to winnow him as Wheat; but Christ prayed that his Faith might not fail; and observe, The main thing that is to be exercised in the time of temptation is Faith, if Faith doth not fail, the soul is well enough; and Christ praies for this: Now you know what Christ saith, <hi>That his Father doth hear him alwaies.</hi> In time of temptation it's best to pray much rather than to reason with temptations, and make use of the prayer of
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:118704:181"/> Jesus Christ: Oh blessed God, did not thy Son when he was in the daies of his Flesh, pray for one of his Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, that when Satan would sift and winnow him, that his Faith might not fail; Oh Lord let me have the fruit and benefit of this Prayer: this is that which I act my Faith upon.</p>
                     <p>Again, The stirring up Faith is the special help against temptations; in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 9. you shall see there, that the way against temptations is not for the soul to sink down in a sullen and discontented way to have horror and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to overwhelm it, but to stir up an act of Faith; in verse 8. he saith, <hi>That our Adversary the Devil like a roaring Lyon walketh about, seeking whom he may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, whom resist</hi> STEADFAST <hi>in the Faith:</hi> It is the work of Faith<note place="margin">

                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>stiff, solid, setled.</hi>
                        </note> that is the great help in resisting the strength of temptations; 'tis not so much to stand reasoning the case, Oh this temptation is a hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thing, and I hope I shall never yield unto it; no, but exercise Faith, and this Shield of Faith will quench the fiery darts of the Devil, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6. 16. Faith is not only a Shield to keep off the fiery darts, but to quench them.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 Besides, Know for the help of thy Faith in time of temptation, That Christ hath broke the Serpents head already, he hath broke it for thee, according to that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, <hi>The seed of the Woman shall break the Serpents head:</hi> The Serpent can but nibble at thy heel, his head is broke, his strength is over-power'd; and the conquest that Christ hath over the Devil we find set out in <hi>Coloss.</hi> 2. 14, 15. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 14, 15. In <hi>Col.</hi> 2. it's said, <hi>And having spoiled Principalities and Powers, be made a shew of them openly, triumphing over them in it;</hi> that is, in his Cross, <hi>He hath spoyled Principalities and Powers:</hi> by Principalities and Powers, must be meant, the Angels of Darkness, the Devils, he hath spoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them; when he was upon the Cross, he took away
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:118704:182"/> their power, and spoiled them, <hi>and triumphed over them:</hi> so that they should never be able to mischief his Saints walk by Faith in temptations by exercising of it upon this expression of Christ. And the other Scripture in <hi>Heb. 2. For as much then as the children are parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same, that through death he might destroy him that hath the power of death, that is, the Devil: And deliver them who through fear of death, were all their life time subject to bondage:</hi> Here's a most sweet and excellent Scripture to exercise Faith upon in time of temptation; Christ through death, hath destroyed him that hath the Power of death, that is, the Devil; the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil comes with hideous temptations, and tels thee thou shalt die and perish, and makes thee apprehend death in a very terrible manner: Christ hath destroyed him, to deliver thee who through the fear of death wert all thy life time subject to bondage: It may be through the strength of temptation, all thy daies thou hast been in bondage; now this was one end why Christ died, that he might destroy the Devil that hath so much power in death, to afflict the soul with the dreadful apprehensions of it.</p>
                     <p n="6">6 And then likewise, Know there are many excellent and sweet Promises that we have in Scripture, that temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation shall not prevail; and the way to help against that is to turn to those Scriptures, and to work thy Faith up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them; as I'le name some, 1 <hi>Cor. 10. 13. There hath no temptation taken you, but such as is common to men; but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bean it:</hi> Here's as full an expression as our hearts can desire; But God will not suffer us to be tempted above our strength, but will with the temptation also make a way <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>o escape: Plead this Promise with God in Prayer, act thy Faith upon this Promise, challenge this Promise in the time of
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:118704:182"/> temptation, and this is the way for to be delivered from the strength of temptation: And in <hi>Rom. 16. 20. The God of Peace shall tread down Satan under your feet shortly: The God of Peace;</hi> observe, it's not only a Promise that Satan shall be trodden down, but God shall tread him down as a God of Peace: And mark the issue of the acting of Faith upon such Promises as these: In <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 38, 39. you know what the Triumph of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle was, That <hi>he was perswaded that neither Death, nor Life, nor Angels, nor Principalities, nor Powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other Creature should ever separate him from the Love of God;</hi> not the chief of all the Devils: And his soul triumphs in this.</p>
                     <p n="7">7 Yea further, For the help of thy Faith, be sure to remember this Rule, That if you think to overcome Temptations by reasoning, the Devil will be too hard for you, for he is the old Serpent, very full of Skill, Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, and great experience that he hath had for these six thousand years; Oh there are Wiles of Satan, and Depths of Satan, he hath more Natural strength in Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, and a deeper reach in things, than all the men in the world have; though he be fallen, yet he hath not lost all the Natural Understanding that he had when God made him, and therefore thou being a poor weak Beleever, thou canst not be able to stand against him by Reasoning no more than against the most cunning Chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that ever liv'd in the world.</p>
                     <p n="8">8 Yea, Let me tell you by way of Encouragement for the acting of your Faith in the time of Temptation, That it is not such a heavy condition for the Lord to let the Devil out upon one in the most strongest and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest Temptation, as for the Devil to have power to draw to any sin; or the power of sin that God leaves any man unto, is a greater evil than the strongest temptation that ever befel any in the world; for the Devil though he be strong, yet he is not able to force any man to sin: To be
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:118704:183"/> given up therefore to the power of any one sin, is a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier Judgment than to be given up to the most strongest temptation of the Devil.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> But you will say, <hi>It may be that's my case: may a poor afflicted soul say, Oh! me thinks I feel cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption to be exceeding strong in me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> For the Answer to that, The opposition of thy soul, when it is not only thy Conscience, but thy Will and Affections against sin: Corruptions stirs in thee, but thou canst appeal to God, not only because Conscience puts thee upon it, but thou findest thy very heart, thy Will and Affections opposing this: This is a greater good, than the other is an evil, and therefore thou shouldest not be discouraged.</p>
                     <p>Again Secondly, Walk by Faith even in the stirrings of corruption, for the Lord hath made a gracious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, that sin shall not have dominion over you, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 14. Oh plead that Promise with God, put that Bond in suit, and act your Faith upon that Promise; Oh Lord, sin stirs forth in me, and I am afraid lest it should prevail: But hast not thou said Lord, it shall not have dominion over me?</p>
                     <p n="9">9 Further, For the help of thy Faith, even in the time of the stirrings of corruption, take that Scripture in <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 6. the Lord is there said to be merciful even to the ungodly in a way of Justification, for so he speaks of that, <hi>For when we were yet without strength, in due time, Christ died for the ungodly:</hi> Though there be much ungodliness, yet Christ is propounded as dying for the ungodly, therefore if one that is ungodly can act Faith upon the death of Christ, I mean, hath seen much ungodliness prevailing in him, but now can act Faith up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on such a Promise as that is, <hi>That Christ died for the ungodly,</hi> there may be walking by Faith, though there be much corruption prevailing.</p>
                     <p>And know, That thou having to deal with God in the way of a Covenant of Grace; there may be many
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:118704:183"/> Imperfections, and much Corruption may stand with the Covenant of Grace; though it's true, to live under the power of any known sin cannot stand with the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, yet much stirring of corruptions, and many times prevailing of corruptions may stand with the Covenant: We know if a Usurper come and seek to have Dominion over a Country that doth not belong to him, so long as there is opposition that he cannot get upon the Throne to make Laws, and to cause the men to lay down their weapons, he hath no dominion there; but when he gets the power so as to sit upon the Throne, and men cast down their Weapons and come and submit to his Laws, he hath Dominion: And so sin shall never have Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over the Saints.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, Do thou act thy Faith even in this case upon the Attributes of God, as I hinted before in the General, when I treated about acting of Faith when God is out of sight; so when corruption prevails, do thou look up to God, as a God gracious, and merciful, and pitiful to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his poor sick children: And suppose that thou hadst a child that were got into an inward room, and had shut the door, and there wringing of his hands and making his moan, Oh that he can love his Father and Mother no more; Oh then how would thy bowels yern towards him, though indeed there be much untowardness in the child: <hi>I have heard</hi> Ephraim <hi>bemoaning himself,</hi> saith God: If thou when thou art alone doest bemoan thy self that thou hast such a disobedient heart, that thou canst love, and fear, and obey God no more; surely thou hast to deal with a Father that will spare his, as a Father spareth his only Son that serveth him, and therefore walk by Faith notwithstanding such corruptions that do much trouble thee, and many times prevail upon thee.</p>

<pb n="429" facs="tcp:118704:184"/> up on God, it's God in Christ that is the proper object for the eye of Faith to look upon You know <hi>Moses</hi> in the 11. to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> was willing to endure affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with the people of God; but how? he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>aw him that was invisible, <hi>He did endure,</hi> he went on in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant way of suffering afflictions, but it was by the sight of that God that was invisible. Now the eye of Faith by pitching its self upon God, doth mightily carry the heart through afflictions.</p>
                     <p>As thus, It sees in Afflictions the Love of God; in <hi>Heb. 12. 6. God chastises whom he loves;</hi> how can this be seen, but by Faith? when God chastises me, yet he loves me; and how easie is it for the soul to walk with God in afflictions, when he can see Love in the Rod? And so in <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 19. there's the Love of God in afflictions.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, There's the Wisdom of God in afflictions, he works wisely in afflictions; the Lord considers what affliction is, and he measures out afflictions sutable unto the conditions of his Servants that are in affliction: you have a most excellent Scripture for that, in <hi>Psalm,</hi> 31. 7. where the Psalmist saith, <hi>I will be glad, and rejoyce in thy mercy, for thou hast considered my trouble; thou hast known my soul in adversities: Thou hast conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red my trouble;</hi> A man that is impatient under trouble he himself considers his trouble with all the circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Arguments of it: but thou shalt not need to consider thy trouble, to be so poring upon thy trouble, God himself considers thy trouble, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siders what a proportion there is in the trouble to thy strength; the Lord considers the Kind of the trouble, the Lord considers the Degree of the trouble, the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of it, and the Continuance of it: there's nothing to be considered in any trouble, but God considers of it. Oh it's a great help to a soul to walk by Faith to consider this; There is nothing in my affliction that is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered of, but Lord, thou doest consider of it.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 And then the soul looks upon Gods Faithfulness in
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:118704:185"/> afflictions in <hi>Psalm, 119. 75. In very faithfulness thou hast afflicted me:</hi> There is a Faithfulness in this, as well as in fulfilling Promises; and you know Faithfulness is a special Object for Faith.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 And then the soul looks upon Gods tenderness in the time of affliction, how compassionate and sensible God is of my afflictions; in <hi>Isa. 63. 9. In all their affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction he was afflicted;</hi> he was afflicted himself, he was sensible of all those afflictions, he did Sympathize with them in the Furnace.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 Again, The Soul doth look upon Gods Protection in afflictions, and so exercises Faith: it's a notable Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in <hi>Psal. 57. 1. Thou wilt hide me under the shadow of thy wings until these calamities be overpast:</hi> his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions were very grievous and sad; but mark how he exercises Faith, he looks upon himself as under the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of Gods wings.</p>
                     <p n="6">6 Further: Faith, it takes hold of the Strength of God in Afflictions, and so comes to have strength to bear afflictions beyond all natural strength: that Scripture is most famous for this, in <hi>Isa.</hi> 27. for the way of the soul in exercising Faith in the time of afflictions, <hi>Or let him take hold of my strength, that he may make peace with me, and shall make peace with me:</hi> The Lord there was speaking of his Church as a Vine in the beginning of the Chapter: Now as a Vine hath little strings that God hath in the Work of Nature put into it for to catch hold upon any thing that is next it to under-prop it; because the Vine is a weak Creature in its self, therefore God supplies the want of strength by those little strings: So saith he, Let him take hold of my strength, let him by Faith, when storms and tempests, when afflictions comes, let him by Faith take hold of my strength: as the Vine in the time of a storm, if she can catch hold upon any strong thing to support it, the Vine keeps up, whereas o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise it falls upon the ground: So if there be Faith to take hold of the strength of God in the time of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:118704:185"/> then the soul is supported and enabled to go through the affliction.</p>
                     <p n="7">7 Yea further, Faith doth not only take hold of Gods Strength, but that's one remarkable thing, Faith looks upon God as making of it the greatest thing that himself doth delight and glory in, namely, to help his Servants in time of affliction; as in <hi>Isa.</hi> 25. 4. there you shall find the Prophet setting God out in his Glory, and it is in the helping of his people out of their afflictions, and so <hi>Isa.</hi> 30. 18. the Lord waits to be gracious, as a work that his heart is most set upon: and in the latter end of the 7. of <hi>Micah, Who is a God like unto thee, pardoning iniquity, transgression, and sin?</hi> and so he goes on in shewing of his pity▪ and compassion towards his Servants: <hi>Who is a God like unto thee?</hi> and that in this thing, in the way of his Mercy: God when he would shew his Glory to <hi>Moses,</hi> he shewed the Glory of the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes of his Goodness, and Mercy: Now when Faith can look thus upon God, God is not only able and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, but accounts it his great Glory, the great Master<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece of all his Works to be helpful to his poor Servants in the daies of their troubles and afflictions: Upon this the soul walks by Faith▪</p>

                        <p>Faith helps the soul in time of affliction. 1 By taking away guilt, which makes afflictions heavy. 2 And by turning them into good. 3 By concluding delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance as present. 4 By resting upon the Word. 5 By making up all comforts in God.</p>

                     <p n="1">1 ANd then another thing wherein Faith helps the soul is this: Faith takes away the guilt of sin, and so makes the affliction easie to be born; it takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the guiltiness, and so it comes to purifie the heart; guiltiness makes afflictions very heavy and sad: When <hi>Josephs</hi> Brethr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="432" facs="tcp:118704:186"/> in <hi>Gen. 42. 21. That</hi> made the affliction to sting indeed: Faith takes away guiltiness: That place in <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 1. is notable for this, <hi>We being justified by Faith, have peace with God;</hi> and what then? <hi>We rejoyce in Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations:</hi> We can easily rejoyce in Tribulations, if we be justified by Faith, and so we have peace with God; it's the guilt of sin that is the sting in afflictions: Saith <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Strike Lord, strike, for I am absolved from my sin:</hi> Let God take away guilt, it's an easie matter to bear af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions: And this is the proper work of Faith to justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the soul before the Lord, and to take away the Curse in Afflictions: All the sting and curse of an affliction comes by sin, it comes by the Law; Faith acts upon the afflictions of Christ, upon what Christ hath suffered, and so comes to take away the sting of all afflictions; <hi>Oh Death, where is thy sting?</hi> under the word <hi>Death,</hi> is comprehended al the forerunners to it, <hi>Oh Death, where is thy sting? Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ:</hi> It's all taken away in the Lord Jesus Christ; and so Faith it comes to turn Afflictions into Good, our Water into Wine.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Afflictions that were evil before, they come to be turned into Good: As when <hi>Moses</hi> took up the Serpent; it was a Serpent before he touch'd it, but when he took it up, it was a rod in his hand, of use unto him: So though Afflictions in themselves be as a Serpent ready to devour, yet being toucht by the hand of Faith, they are a Rod, and such a Rod as is useful, they are turned into good? and this is the work of Faith to make such a strange kind of alteration in afflictions: there's a notable Scripture in <hi>Job,</hi> 5. 19. speaking concerning af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, <hi>He shall deliver thee in six troubles, yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee;</hi> it's a very strange expression: though thou beest under many troubles, no evil shall touch you; the evil is taken away, the sting is gone, though the trouble be there: If the sting be taken out of a Bee, though it may make a buzzing so as to
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:118704:186"/> scare a child, yet a man of understanding is not afraid.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Again, Faith doth enable the soul to look upon the Issue of Afflictions as present, and to conclude deliverance out of afflictions, though it be not actual, yet to make it as actual, and real; as in <hi>Hosea, 6. 2. After three daies he will revive us: He Will,</hi> though he hath smit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten us, yet we can look upon our reviving as a certain thing; <hi>After three daies, he will revive us:</hi> And in <hi>Job, 23. 10. I shall come forth as Gold:</hi> I know what the issue of all will be, it will be good; and this is as present to the soul, the soul by Faith doth see the quiet fruit of Righteousness that will come of all Afflictions: How easie is it to walk by Faith in Afflictions, when I can see the Issue of all as present, and good coming out of all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 Again, Faith helps in Afflictions by resting upon the Word: In the 119. <hi>Psalm,</hi> 49, 50. there <hi>David</hi> tells you what it was that did support him in the time of his affliction, namely, <hi>The Word:</hi> This is the way that a Beleever helps himself in afflictions; he doth not so much fly to this Duty, or the other Duty, and fall a whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and crying out, and wringing his hands, and shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing passion and distemper; but goes and turns over the Word, and if he find the Word speaking well unto him, that's that which doth support the soul in the time of trouble; when God saith, I will be with you in six troubles, and in seven, and in the fire, and in the water, that they shall do you no hurt: these things doth Faith rest upon. The Promises that God hath made to help the soul in afflictions, are exceeding many; take that one Scripture in the 27. of <hi>Isa. 7, 8. Hath he smitten him as he smot those that smot him? or is he slain accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the slaughter of them that are slain by him? In measure, when it shooteth forth, thou wilt deba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>e with it: he stayeth his rough wind in the day of the East wind:</hi> it's as sweet and excellent a Scripture for Faith to rest upon, almost as any I know: The day of the East
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:118704:187"/> wind, it's a day of a great deal of trouble and danger, a cold and nipping wind; but God staies his rough wind, he doth pity them, and in measure he will debate; they are as yong tender buds, and God sees that if the rough wind should come upon them, that they were not able to bear it, and therfore God deals with them according to their tenderness: Oh that you would consider of this, you that think your afflictions great; as every man and woman is ready to think <hi>their</hi> affliction to be the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test: It is an East wind that is upon you, but there might have come a rough wind in the day of the East wind, but God staies that, because in measure he would debate with you; in <hi>Psal.</hi> 103. 13, 14.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 Besides, In Afflictions Faith exercises thus; It makes up all in God; such and such Creature Comforts are taken from me, but Faith is such an excellent Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as it makes up al in God: this is as great an excellency of Faith as any, and those that are Beleevers, know what the meaning of this is: This I confess is a riddle to many, To make up their losses in God; such an heavy affliction hath befallen me, but when the soul can go and make up all in God, here's the work of Faith, to close with God, the Lord is an Al-sufficient good, and what I had before in the Creature, was but as in the Pipe or Conduit; but I have the Fountain now in having God: This is the principal work of Faith; <hi>I thirst for thee</hi> (saith <hi>David) in a dry Land;</hi> not for Water, but for Thee, for thou canst make up the want of water; this is the very Nature of this Grace: What is the very chief work of Faith but this, The giving up its self wholly to God as the Alsuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient good, as its Infinite Alsufficient good, and to be satisfied in him alone whatsoever I want in any Creature? This is the very Primary act of Faith, and the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Faith appears in this; and therefore it's very use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the day of <hi>Jacobs</hi> trouble.</p>

                        </note> (saith the Apostle) <hi>by the mighty Power of God,</hi> but how? <hi>through Faith unto Salvation:</hi> we are kept by the Power of God, but through Faith: 'Tis not enough for you to say, that there is an Infinite and Glorious God, that hath all Power and Excellency in him; but there's none of this Power that will be let out to you, but through Faith, it must be through an Act of Faith: Oh what hath God laid upon this Grace of Faith, that though he hath so much Power to help the Creature, yet he saith all my Power shall wait upon the exercise of Faith, I wil stay till I see Faith be put forth, before I will put forth Power in any extremity: you know what Christ saith, <hi>He could not do any great work, because of their Ʋnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lees:</hi> why blessed Savior? what is thy Power lessened that thou canst not do any great work? It is because of their Unbeleef; Unbeleef comes and stops, as it were, the Arms of an Infinite Power: Thou art a poor weak Creature, and art afraid that thou shalt fall off, Oh how shall I be kept through all the tryals, and dangers, and discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments I meet withal in my wilderness travels? God is able to do it; but how shalt thou have the use of this Power? It must be through
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:118704:188"/> Faith. Oh the necessity that there is of Faith then in an afflicted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: And this exercise of Faith will mightily quiet the soul in the time of affliction: In <hi>Psalm,</hi> 62. you have an excellent Scripture for the quieting of your hearts in the daies of affliction by the exercise of Faith; <hi>My soul, wait thou upon God:</hi> it may be read according to the Original thus, <hi>My soul, do thou keep silent to God, for my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation is from him.</hi> By the exercise of Faith the soul is <hi>Silent.</hi> But that which I would further note from this Scripture, is this: It may be you will say, I have endeavored to put forth an act of Faith in the time of my affliction, and yet for all that I do not find my heart quiet. Though thou hast endeavored once, yet do it again.</p>
                     <p>You shall observe how the soul gets ground by the exercise of Faith in the time of affliction, if you compare the beginning of this 62. <hi>Psalm</hi> with the middle, <hi>Truly my soul waiteth upon God, from him cometh my Salvation; he only is my Rock, and my Salvation: He is my desence, I shal not be greatly moved:</hi> At first he was only able to say thus, <hi>He is my defence, and my rock, I shall not be greatly moved:</hi> But remember, after he had been exercising Faith, he hath a higher expression than before, in the 6. verse. <hi>He only is my Rock, and my Salvation; he is my Defence, I shall not be moved:</hi> Now I am sixt, whatsoever storms and troubles come, I am i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Oh that you would but lay up these things that you may have Faith in a readiness whensoever it should come to act: as that place in the Psalms that speaks of <hi>David</hi> in the trouble of his Spirit, he saith, <hi>That at what time he was afraid, he would trust in God:</hi> not only this, that <hi>David</hi> was afraid, but at what time he was afraid, he would trust in God: so against what time thou art afflicted, thou shouldest lay up these things that thou mayest have use of them, as <hi>Mary</hi> hid Christs sayings in her heart: At the time when thou art afflicted, the time when temptation comes, the time when God hides himself, the time when God appears as an enemy; now know that God calls thee to the exercise of this glorious Grace of Faith, <hi>Which is the SUBSTANCE of things hoped</hi>
